Then, when the Persians invaded Nisibis, he fled with his disciples to Edessa in Syria, where he set down the fundamentals of a school of theology, fulfilling his ministry by his words and writings.  So striking is the austerity of his life and the clarity of his teaching that from the exquisite hymns he composed he has deserved to be called the harp of the Holy Spirit. (378)"

John chose Jan. 30 to commemorate all three of them together, and composed the office. \n The holy bishop martyr Hippolytus was a priest of the Church of Rome famous for his learning.

Born in Veliky Bychkiv in Carpatho-Russia in 1911, he came from a poor family and exhibited a vocation to the priesthood.  Sent to Rome for studies, he was ordained in 1937 and sent to the country parish of Berzovo.  In 1939, he was called to the seminary at Uzhhorod and taught there until 1944.  In 1944, despite his youth, he was ordained bishop for the Mukachevo Eparchy.  During the Soviet Army’s occupation of Carpatho-Russia, he was tireless in his care for his flock and in his defense of the rights of the Byzantine Catholic Church.  On October 27, 1947, he was severely wounded in a staged accident.  He was taken to the hospital in Mukachevo, where he was subsequently poisoned, and died. (1947)  His primary feast is kept on November 1, the day of his death.  On June 28 2003, Blessed Theodore's relics were solemnly transferred to the Cathedral Church of the Holy Cross in Uzhorod, Ukraine.

Having heard of Jesus the healer in Palestine, he sent a portrait painter named Ananias with a letter to Jesus, asking him to come and cure his leprosy.  Being unable to come, the Lord took a napkin and wiped his face, leaving a perfect reproduction of the Holy Face on it.  Ananias took the napkin back to Abgar, along with the message that he would be partially cured of his disease, and later completely.  The Apostle Thaddeus of the Seventy, preaching the Gospel, came to Abgar and healed him.\n The holy martyr Diomedes was a physician from Tarsus who taught people the Christian faith as he ministered to their suffering bodies.  The emperor Diocletian ordered him to be beheaded in Nicea. (298) Diomedes is commemorated at Compline."

Samuel preached repentance to the children of Israel, and led the people to victory over the Philistines.  Asked by the people to give them a king, he warned them that God was the only true king of Israel, but they insisted.  It was Samuel who anointed Saul son of Kish as the first King of Israel, and David son of Jesse as its second and greatest ruler.  He died in Ramah and was buried there.\n The holy king Stephen of Hungary, who, regenerated by his baptism, received his crown of kingship from Pope Silvester II, provided for the propagation of the faith of Christ among the Hungarians, established the Church in his kingdom, and endowed monasteries with his riches. He was just and peaceful in ruling his subjects, until at Alba Regalis [modern Székesfehérvár] in Hungary on the day of the Assumption his soul traveled to heaven.(1038)"

She brought up her sons in the Faith as well.  Her husband handed her over to the torturers with her sons.  They were beheaded in the persecution of Maximian.  (3rd century)\nOur holy father Pius X, pope of Rome, was born in the village of Riese in the province of Venice in 1835.  After he became a priest, he performed his duties with distinction.  He was made bishop of Mantua, then patriarch of Venice, and was elected pope in 1903.  He took as the motto of his pontificate “To renew all things in Christ.”  He fulfilled this task in the spirit of simplicity, poverty, and courage, arousing the faithful to a Christian way of life and waging constant warfare against the errors of his age.  He renewed the prayer of Christians and the chant of the western Church, and urged young children to approach the Lord’s table.  (1914)"

He was dumb until the age of five, and his first word was ‘mama,’ and it is from this word that his name derives.  At the age of fifteen, he was brought before the emperor Aurelian.  The emperor commanded him to blaspheme Christ, and Mammas replied, “I shall not deny my God and King Jesus Christ, either in my heart or with my lips.”  After many forms of torture, Mammas was martyred by a pagan priest. (274)\n Our venerable father John the Faster, patriarch of Constantinople. Originally a goldsmith, John was called to the priesthood as a young man.  He was eventually chosen to be the Patriarch of Constantinople.  He practiced fasting assiduously; he was both a man of prayer and a wonderworker right up to his death. (595)"

When St. Helena found the Lord’s cross in Jerusalem, she stayed longer in the city and built churches in Gethsemane, in Bethlehem, on the Mount of Olives, and in other places connected to the life and death of the Lord.   She began to build a huge church on Golgatha, which would house both the hill of Calvary and the tomb from which the Lord rose.  St. Helena died before it was finished, and the church was consecrated on this date in 335.\n The holy bishop martyr Cornelius the Centurion, who was an officer in Palestine converted by the Apostle Peter (cf Acts 10).  That same apostle made him bishop and sent him to the pagan town of Skepseis.  There he destroyed the temple of Apollo and baptized the local ruler.  He was martyred in that town and buried with reverence by his church."

On October 1, 911, during the reign of emperor Leo the Wise, there was an all-night vigil in the Blachernae church of the Theotokos in Constantinople.  Standing near the rear of the church was St. Andrew the Fool for Christ, and his disciple Epiphanius.  At four o’clock in the morning, the Theotokos appeared above the people with a veil spread over her outstretched hands, as if to protect them.  She was surrounded by angels and saints.  Seeing this, Andrew asked his disciple, “Do you see the Queen and Lady of all is praying for the whole world?” \n      The holy apostle Ananias, who baptized St. Paul in Damascus, as is related in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 9:10-19)\nOur venerable father Romanus, deacon, who merited the name \"the Melodist\" from his sublime art in composing ecclesiastical hymns in honor of the Lord and the saints. (496)\nOur venerable mother Therese of the Child Jesus, who entered the Carmelite monastery of Lisieux in France while still a youth and was made a master of sanctity in Christ in innocence and simplicity.  She taught a way of Christian perfection through spiritual spiritual childhood and poured herself out in the salvation of souls and in care for the mystical increase of the Church.  She fell asleep in the Lord in her twenty-fifth year of life, on the thirtieth day of September. (1897)"

Andronicus was a goldsmith in Antioch during the reign of emperor Theodosius the Great.  Both he and his wife were very devout, and gave a third of all they eared to the poor.  They had two children and lost both of them on the same day to death.  After this, they took the monastic habit in Egypt.  After many years of the monastic life, they died eight days apart; Athanasia first, and then Andronicus. (4th century) Andronicus and Athanasia are remembered at Compline.\nOur righteous forefather Abraham and his nephew, Lot.  Abraham is accounted patriarch and father of all believers.  Calling to the Lord, he went out from the city of Ur of the Chaldees, his native land, and wandered through the land promised to him and to his descendants by God. Likewise he showed his total faith in God when, hoping against hope, he did not refuse to offer his only-begotten son Isaac to God in sacrifice. Isaac had been given to Abraham as an old man by the Lord from his sterile wife, Sarah.  (cf. Genesis, chapters 12-25)\n The holy martyr Denis, bishop of Paris.  It is said that he was sent by the Roman Pontiff to Gaul and was made the first bishop of Paris. He died a martyr near Lutetia, together with the priest Rusticus and the deacon Eleutherius.

During the Soviet Army’s occupation of Carpatho-Russia, he was tireless in his care for his flock and in his defense of the rights of the Byzantine Catholic Church.
