They appeared in a dream to then Patriarch John and told him that they were equal before God, and each had his special gifts and talents.  John chose Jan. 30 to commemorate all three of them together, and composed the office. \n The holy bishop martyr Hippolytus was a priest of the Church of Rome famous for his learning.  After he unjustly accused Archdeacon Callistus, he was exiled from Rome and rebelled against the authority of the Pope.  He repented and was reconciled to the church, and was martyred. (235)"

Having heard of Jesus the healer in Palestine, he sent a portrait painter named Ananias with a letter to Jesus, asking him to come and cure his leprosy.  Being unable to come, the Lord took a napkin and wiped his face, leaving a perfect reproduction of the Holy Face on it.  Ananias took the napkin back to Abgar, along with the message that he would be partially cured of his disease, and later completely.  The Apostle Thaddeus of the Seventy, preaching the Gospel, came to Abgar and healed him.\n The holy martyr Diomedes was a physician from Tarsus who taught people the Christian faith as he ministered to their suffering bodies.  The emperor Diocletian ordered him to be beheaded in Nicea. (298) Diomedes is commemorated at Compline."

Samuel preached repentance to the children of Israel, and led the people to victory over the Philistines.  Asked by the people to give them a king, he warned them that God was the only true king of Israel, but they insisted.  It was Samuel who anointed Saul son of Kish as the first King of Israel, and David son of Jesse as its second and greatest ruler.  He died in Ramah and was buried there.\n The holy king Stephen of Hungary, who, regenerated by his baptism, received his crown of kingship from Pope Silvester II, provided for the propagation of the faith of Christ among the Hungarians, established the Church in his kingdom, and endowed monasteries with his riches. He was just and peaceful in ruling his subjects, until at Alba Regalis [modern Székesfehérvár] in Hungary on the day of the Assumption his soul traveled to heaven.(1038)"

She brought up her sons in the Faith as well.  Her husband handed her over to the torturers with her sons.  They were beheaded in the persecution of Maximian.  (3rd century)\nOur holy father Pius X, pope of Rome, was born in the village of Riese in the province of Venice in 1835.  After he became a priest, he performed his duties with distinction.  He was made bishop of Mantua, then patriarch of Venice, and was elected pope in 1903.  He took as the motto of his pontificate “To renew all things in Christ.”  He fulfilled this task in the spirit of simplicity, poverty, and courage, arousing the faithful to a Christian way of life and waging constant warfare against the errors of his age.  He renewed the prayer of Christians and the chant of the western Church, and urged young children to approach the Lord’s table.  (1914)"

Standing near the rear of the church was St. Andrew the Fool for Christ, and his disciple Epiphanius.  At four o’clock in the morning, the Theotokos appeared above the people with a veil spread over her outstretched hands, as if to protect them.  She was surrounded by angels and saints.  Seeing this, Andrew asked his disciple, “Do you see the Queen and Lady of all is praying for the whole world?” \n      The holy apostle Ananias, who baptized St. Paul in Damascus, as is related in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 9:10-19)\nOur venerable father Romanus, deacon, who merited the name \"the Melodist\" from his sublime art in composing ecclesiastical hymns in honor of the Lord and the saints.

She fell asleep in the Lord in her twenty-fifth year of life, on the thirtieth day of September. (1897)"

Because of this, he left the army and went into the desert to live with wild beasts.  Menas was arrested by a pagan governor and tortured and martyred with his companions Victor and Vincent.  (304) \nThe holy martyr Stephanis volunteered to die with Vincent. (304)\n\nOur venerable father and confessor Theodore the Studite was hegumen of that monastery in Constantinople who suffered greatly for his defense of the cult of the holy icons.
