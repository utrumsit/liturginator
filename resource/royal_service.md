[The Royal Service]

**Logic Note:** If Lent (Great Forty Day Fast), include introductory prayers (Trisagion, etc.) after blessing. Otherwise, skip to "Come let us worship."

*If it is the Great Forty Day Fast, after Blessed is our God:*
say: Trisagion. Most holy Trinity: After Our Father: Lord,
have mercy 12. Glory: now and ever:

Come, let us worship our King and God.  
Come, let us worship Christ, our King and God.  
Come, let us worship and bow before the only Lord Jesus Christ, the King and our God.

*three times, and the two psalms.*

*But if it is not, after the blessing:*

Come, let us worship our King and God.  
Come, let us worship Christ, our King and God.  
Come, let us worship and bow before the only Lord Jesus Christ, the King and our God.

*three times, and the psalms.*

Psalm 19

May the Lord answer in time of trial;  
May the name of Jacob’s God protect you.  

May He send you help from His shrine  
and give you support from Zion.  
May He remember all your offerings  
and receive your sacrifice with favor.  

May He give you your heart’s desire  
and fulfill every one of your plans.  
May we ring out with joy at your victory  
And rejoice in the name of our God.  

May the Lord grant all our prayers.  
I am sure now that the Lord  
will give victory to His anointed,  
will reply from His holy heaven  
with the mighty victory of His hand.  

Some trust in chariots or horses,  
but we in the name of the Lord.  
They will collapse and fall,  
but we shall hold and stand firm.  

Give victory to the king, O Lord,  
give answer on the day we call.  

Psalm 20

O Lord, Your strength gives joy to the king;  
How Your saving help makes him glad!  
You have granted him his heart’s desire;  
You have not refused the prayer of his lips.  

You came to meet him with the blessings of success,  
You have set on his head a crown of pure gold.  
He asked You for life and this You have given,  
days that will last from age to age.  

Your saving help has given him glory.  
You have laid upon him majesty and splendor.  
You have granted Your blessings to him for ever.  
You have made him rejoice with the joy of Your presence.  

The king has put his trust in the Lord;  
through the mercy of the Most High he shall stand firm.  

His hand will seek and find all his foes,  
his right hand find out those that hate him.  

You will burn them like a blazing furnace  
on the day when You appear.  
And the Lord shall destroy them in His anger;  
fire will swallow them up.  

You will wipe out their race from the earth  
and their children from the sons of men.  
Though they plan evil against You,  
though they plot, they shall not prevail.  

For You will force them to retreat;  
at them You will aim with Your bow.  
O Lord, arise in Your strength;  
we shall sing and praise Your power.  

*Glory: now and ever:* Trisagion. Most holy Trinity: Our

Father: For Thine is the kingdom:

*And these troparia:*

Save Your people, O Lord, and bless Your inheritance.  
Grant victory to Your Church over evil and protect Your  
people by Your cross.  

*Glory:*

Christ our God, Who were willingly raised upon the cross,  
grant Your mercies to the new people who bear Your Name.  
By Your power grant joy to the Church. Give her victory over  
evil with Your invincible trophy, the weapon of peace, as an  
ally.  

*Now and ever:*
