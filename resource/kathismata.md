# The Kathismata of the Psalter

In the Byzantine Rite, the 150 psalms are divided up into twenty
sections of roughly equal length, to be chanted at the various
liturgical services of the daily cycle.

Originally, those present stood for the chanting of the psalms(s), and
then sat afterwards to listen to the hymns that accompanied them. So
each section of the psalm came to be called a \"sitting\" (in Greek,
**kathisma**)*.* This article describes the kathismata of the psalter
and their liturgical use.

## The Kathismata

According to the custom of our church, we use the numbering of the
Psalms found in the Greek Bible; see [Psalms](Psalms.html) for more
about the numbering of the psalms.

 ------------- ----------------
 Kathisma 1 Psalms 1-8
 Kathisma 2 Psalms 9-16
 Kathisma 3 Psalms 17-23
 Kathisma 4 Psalms 24-31
 Kathisma 5 Psalms 32-36
 Kathisma 6 Psalms 37-45
 Kathisma 7 Psalms 46-54
 Kathisma 8 Psalms 55-63
 Kathisma 9 Psalms 64-69
 Kathisma 10 Psalms 70-76
 Kathisma 11 Psalms 77-84
 Kathisma 12 Psalms 85-90
 Kathisma 13 Psalms 91-100
 Kathisma 14 Psalms 101-104
 Kathisma 15 Psalms 105-108
 Kathisma 16 Psalms 109-117
 Kathisma 17 Psalm 118
 Kathisma 18 Psalms 119-133
 Kathisma 19 Psalms 134-142
 Kathisma 20 Psalms 143-150
 ------------- ----------------

Each kathisma (\"sitting\") is further divided into three \"standings\"
(**stations** or ***stases***), but these divisions are not shown here.

In the [Psalter](Psalter.html), each kathisma is also followed by
troparia and prayers for use in private recitation.

## How the kathismata are used in the liturgy

The kathismata of the psalter may be chanted at the beginning of Vespers
and Matins, according to a fixed weekly system in which the entire book
of psalms is heard in the course of the week (twice during the Great
Fast).

During the **summer** (defined liturgically as from Thomas Sunday
through September 21), one kathisma is chanted at Vespers, and two at
Matins:

 --------- -------- -------- --------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------
   Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
 Matins 2, 3 4, 5 7, 8 10, 11 13, 14 19, 20 16, 17
 Vespers   6 9 12 15 18 1
 --------- -------- -------- --------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------

If you start with Vespers on Saturday evening (lower right corner of the
table) and examine each day in turn, you can see that the kathismata are
chanted in order from one day to the next, skipping the kathisma on
Sunday evening (the Vespers that ends Sunday or a feast of the Lord is
relatively short). Two kathismata, 16 and 17, form an extended
meditation on God\'s law, which is moved to Saturday.

This system is also used from December 20 to January 14 (the liturgical
days of the Christmas/Theophany season), and during Meatfare and
Cheesefare Weeks.

During the **winter** (September 22 to the Sunday of the Prodigal Son,
except for the Christmas season), the \"gradual psalms\" of Kathisma 18
are chanted every evening at Vespers, and more kathismata are chanted at
Matins to compensate:

 --------- ---------- --------- --------- ------------ ------------ -------- ----------
   Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
 Matins 2, 3, 17 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9 10, 11, 12 13, 14, 15 19, 20 16, 17
 Vespers   18 18 18 18 18 1
 --------- ---------- --------- --------- ------------ ------------ -------- ----------

During the **Great Fast**, the psalter is also chanted twice in the
course of the week, by adding kathismata to the daytime Hours:

 ---------- ---------- --------- ------------ ----------- ---------- ------------ ----------
   Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
 Matins 2, 3, 17 4, 5, 6 10, 11, 12 19, 20, 1 6, 7, 8 13, 14, 15 16, 17
 1st Hour     13 2 9
 3rd Hour   7 14 3 10 19
 6th Hour   8 15 4 11 20
 9th Hour   9 16 5 12
 Vespers   18 18 18 18 18 1
 ---------- ---------- --------- ------------ ----------- ---------- ------------ ----------

There are special rules for the kathismata during the 5th week of the
Great Fast (when the Great Canon of Repentence is sung), and for Holy
Week.

Kathismata are not chanted on Pascha or during the week that follows
(Bright Week).
