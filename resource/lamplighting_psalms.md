# Lamplighting Psalms  
  
*"Lord, I Have Cried..."*  
  
## Psalm 140  
  
I have called to you, Lord; hasten to help me!  
Hear my voice when I cry to you.  
Let my prayer arise before you like incense,  
the raising of my hands like an evening oblation.  
Set, O Lord, a guard over my mouth;  
keep watch, O Lord, at the door of my lips!  
Do not turn my heart to things that are wrong,  
to evil deeds with men who are sinners.  
Never allow me to share in their feasting.  
If a just man strikes or reproves me it is kindness  
but let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head.  
Let my prayer be ever against their malice.  
Their princes were thrown down by the side of the rock;  
then they understood that my words were kind.  
As a millstone is shattered to pieces on the ground,  
so their bones were strewn at the mouth of the grave.  
To you, Lord God, my eyes are turned:  
in you I take refuge; spare my soul!  
From the trap they have laid for me keep me safe:  
keep me from the snares of those who do evil.  
Let the wicked fall into the traps they have set  
while I pursue my way unharmed.  
## Psalm 141  
  
With all my voice I cry to the Lord,  
with all my voice I entreat the Lord.  
I pour out my trouble before him;  
I tell him all my distress  
while my spirit faints within me.  
But you, O Lord, know my path.  
On the way where I shall walk  
they have hidden a snare to entrap me.  
Look on my right and see:  
there is no one who takes my part.  
I have no means of escape,  
not one who cares for my soul.  
I cry to you, O Lord.  
I have said: “You are my refuge  
all I have in the land of the living.”  
Listen, then, to my cry  
for I am in the depths of distress.  
Rescue me from those who pursue me  
for they are stronger than I.  
**On 10:** Bring my soul out of this prison  
and then I shall praise your name.  
**On 9:** Around me the just will assemble  
because of your goodness to me.  
  
## Psalm 129  
  
**On 8:** Out of the depths I cry to you, O Lord,  
Lord, hear my voice!  
**On 7:** O let your ears be attentive  
to the voice of my pleading.  
**On 6:** If you, O Lord, should mark our guilt,  
Lord, who would survive?  
But with you is found forgiveness:  
for this we revere you.  
**On 5:** My soul is waiting for the Lord.  
I count on his word.  
My soul is longing for the Lord  
more than watchman for daybreak.  
**On 4:** (Let the watchman count on daybreak  
and Israel on the Lord.)  
**On 3:** Because with the Lord there is mercy  
and fullness of redemption,  
Israel indeed he will redeem  
from all its iniquity.  
  
## Psalm 116  
  
**On 2:** O praise the Lord, all you nations,  
acclaim him all you peoples!  
**On 1:** Strong is his love for us;  
he is faithful for ever.  
  
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit; Now and ever and unto ages of ages. Amen.
