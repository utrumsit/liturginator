*If there is a priest, he says:*

Blessed is our God, always, now and ever and forever.

*And we say:* Amen.

*If there is no priest, say:*

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, O Lord Jesus

Christ, our God, have mercy on us.

*We:* Amen.

Glory to You, our God, glory to You!

Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, everywhere
present and filling all things, Treasury of Blessings and Giver
of Life, come and dwell within us, cleanse us of all stain, and
save our souls, O gracious One.

Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal, have mercy on us. *Three times.*

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,

now and ever and forever. Amen.

Most holy Trinity, have mercy on us; Lord, cleanse us of
our sins; Master, forgive our transgressions; Holy One, come
to us and heal our infirmities for Your Name’s sake.

Lord, have mercy. *Three times.*

*Glory: now and ever:*

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

*The priest:*

For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever.

*And we:* Amen.

*Then:* Lord, have mercy. *Twelve times.*

*Glory: now and ever:*

Come, let us worship our King and God.  
Come, let us worship Christ, our King and God.  
Come, let us worship and bow before the only Lord Jesus Christ, the King and our God.
