## Psalm 103  
  
Bless the Lord, my soul!  
Lord God, how great you are,  
clothed in majesty and glory,  
wrapped in light as in a robe!  
  
You stretch out the heavens like a tent.  
Above the rains you build your dwelling.  
You make the clouds your chariot,  
you walk on the wings of the wind,  
you make the winds your messengers  
and flashing fire your servants.

You founded the earth on its base,  
to stand firm from age to age.  
You wrapped it with the ocean like a cloak:  
the waters stood higher than the mountains.  
At your threat they took to flight;  
at the voice of your thunder they fled.  
They rose over the mountains and flowed down  
to the place which you had appointed.  
You set limits they might not pass  
lest they return to cover the earth.

You make springs gush forth in the valleys;  
they flow in between the hills.  
They give drink to all the beasts of the field;  
the wild asses quench their thirst.  
On their banks dwell the birds of heaven;  
from the branches they sing their song.

From your dwelling you water the hills;  
earth drinks its fill of your gift.  
You make the grass grow for the cattle  
and the plants to serve man's needs,  
that he may bring forth bread from the earth  
and wine to cheer man’s heart;  
oil, to make his face shine  
and bread to strengthen man's heart.

The trees of the Lord drink their fill,  
the cedars he planted on Lebanon;  
there the birds build their nests;  
on the treetop the stork has her home.  
The goats find a home on the mountains  
and rabbits hide in the rocks.  
You made the moon to mark the months;  
the sun knows the time for its setting.

When you spread the darkness it is night  
and all the beasts of the forest creep forth.  
The young lions roar for their prey  
and ask their food from God.  
At the rising of the sun they steal away  
and go to rest in their dens.  
Man goes out to his work,  
to labor till evening falls.

How many are your works, O Lord!  
In wisdom you have made them all.  
The earth is full of your riches.  
There is the sea, vast and wide,  
with its moving swarms past counting,  
living things great and small.  
The ships are moving there  
and the monsters you made to play with.

All of these look to you  
to give them their food in due season.  
You give it, they gather it up:  
you open your hand, they have their fill.  
You hide your face, they are dismayed;  
you take back your spirit, they die,  
returning to the dust from which they came.  
You send forth your spirit, they are created;  
and you renew the face of the earth.

May the glory of the Lord last for ever!  
May the Lord rejoice in his works!  
He looks on the earth and it trembles;  
the mountains send forth smoke at his touch.

I will sing to the Lord all my life,  
make music to my God while I live.  
May my thoughts be pleasing to him.  
I find my joy in the Lord.  
Let sinners vanish from the earth  
and the wicked exist no more.

Bless the Lord, my soul.
  
Glory: Now and ever:  
  
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Glory to You, O God! *Three times.*
