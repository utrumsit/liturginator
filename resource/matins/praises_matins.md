**Psalm 148**

Praise the Lord from the heavens,
Praise Him in the heights.
Praise him, all His angels,
Praise him, all His host.

Praise Him, sun and moon,
Praise Him shining stars.
Praise Him highest heavens
and the waters above the heavens.

Let them praise the name of the Lord.
He commanded; they were made.
He fixed them for ever,
gave a law which shall not pass away.

Praise the Lord from the earth,
sea creatures and all oceans,
fire and hail, snow and mist,
stormy winds that obey His word;

all mountains and hills,
all fruit trees and cedars,
beasts, wild and tame,
reptiles and birds on the wing;

all earth’s kings and peoples,
earth’s princes and rulers;
young men and maidens,
old men together with children.

Let them praise the name of the Lord
for He alone is exalted.
The splendor of His name
reaches beyond heaven and earth.

He exalts the strength of His people.
He is the praise of all His saints,
of the sons of Israel,
of the people to whom He comes close.

**Psalm 149**

Sing a new song to the Lord,
His praise in the assembly of the faithful.
Let Israel rejoice in its Maker,
let Zion’s sons exult in their king.
Let them praise His name with dancing
and make music with timbrel and harp.

For the Lord takes delight in His people.
He crowns the poor with salvation.
Let the faithful rejoice in their glory,
Shout for joy and take their rest.

Let the praise of God be on their lips
And a two-edged sword in their hand,
to deal out vengeance to the nations
And punishment on all the peoples;
To bind their kings in chains
And their nobles in fetters of iron;

to carry out the sentence pre-ordained: this honor
is for all His faithful.

**Psalm 150**

Praise God in His holy place, praise Him in His mighty

heavens.

Praise Him for His powerful deeds, praise His

surpassing greatness.

O praise Him with sound of trumpet, praise Him with lute

and harp.

Praise Him with timbrel and dance, praise Him with

strings and pipe.

O praise Him with resounding cymbals, praise Him
with clashing of cymbals. Let everything that lives and that
breathes give praise to the Lord.
