[The Doxology]

Glory to God in the highest, and to people on earth peace
and good will. We praise You, we bless You, we worship You,
we glorify You, we thank You for Your great glory. Lord God,
heavenly King, Father Almighty; Lord, only-begotten Son,
Jesus Christ, and Holy Spirit. Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of
the Father, You take away the sin of the world, have mercy on
us. You take away the sins of the world, hear our prayer. You
are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.
For You alone are holy, You alone are Lord, Jesus Christ, to
the glory of God the Father. Amen.

I will bless You every day, and praise Your Name forever.
O Lord, You have been our refuge from one generation
to the next. I said: Lord, have mercy on me, heal my soul
for I have sinned against You. O Lord, I have fled to You for
refuge. Teach me to do Your will, for You, O Lord, are my
God. In You is the source of life and in Your light we see light.
Extend Your mercy to those who know You.

Then:

Make us worthy, O Lord, to be kept sinless this morning.
Blessed are You, O Lord, the God of our fathers, and
praiseworthy and glorious is Your Name forever. Amen.

May Your mercy, O Lord, be upon us who have placed
our hope in You. Blessed are You, O Lord; teach me Your
commandments. Blessed are You, O Master; make me
understand Your commandments. Blessed are You, O Holy
One; enlighten me with Your commandments.

O Lord, Your mercy is forever; despise not the work of
Your hands. To You is due praise; to You is due a hymn; to
You is glory due, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever
and forever. Amen.

Choir: To You, O Lord.

Let us complete our morning prayer to the Lord.
Choir: Lord, have mercy.

Protect us, save us, have mercy on us and preserve us, O

God, by Your grace.

Choir: Lord, have mercy.

That this whole day may be perfect, holy, peaceful, and

without sin, let us beseech the Lord.

After each of the following petitions, the choir sings:

Grant this, O Lord.

For an angel of peace, a faithful guide and guardian of our

souls and bodies, let us beseech the Lord.

For the pardon and remission of our sins and offenses, let

us beseech the Lord.

For what is good and beneficial to our souls and for peace

in the world, let us beseech the Lord.

That we may spend the rest of our life in peace and

repentance, let us beseech the Lord.

For a Christian, painless, unashamed, peaceful end of our
life, and for a good account before the fearsome judgment-
seat of Christ, let us beseech the Lord.

Commemorating our most holy, most pure, most blessed
and glorious Lady, the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary, with
all the saints, let us commit ourselves and one another and our
whole life to Christ our God.

The priest exclaims:

For You are a merciful and gracious God, and You love
mankind, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, now and ever and forever.

Choir: Amen.

Priest: Peace be to all.
Choir: And to your spirit.

Deacon: Bow your heads to the Lord.
Choir: To You, O Lord.

And the priest says this prayer quietly:

Holy Lord, You dwell on high and look upon the lowly,
and with Your all-seeing eyes You watch over all creation.
To You we bend our neck in heart and body and we pray
to You, stretch forth Your invisible hand from Your holy
dwelling place and bless us all. If we have sinned voluntarily
or involuntarily forgive us as a good God Who loves mankind
and gives us earthly and heavenly gifts.

He says aloud:

For it is Yours to have mercy on us and to save us, O God,
and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now
and ever and forever.
Choir: Amen.

[Psalm 89]

Verse 1: In the morning, fill us with Your love; we shall
exult and rejoice all our days. Give us joy to balance our
affliction for the years when we knew misfortune. Show forth
Your work to Your servants; let Your glory shine on their
children.

Verse 2: Let the favor of the Lord, our God, be upon us;
give success to the work of our hands! Give success to the
work of our hands!

Glory: now and ever: Theotokion.

Then:

[Psalm 91]

It is good to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises
to Your Name, O most High. To proclaim Your mercy in the
morning, and Your faithfulness throughout the night.

After this, Trisagion. Most holy Trinity: Our Father:

Priest: For Thine is the kingdom:

Troparion of the Saint.

Glory: now and ever: Theotokion.

And immediately the Ektenia of Supplication:

Have mercy on us, O God, according to Your great mercy,

we pray You, hear and have mercy.

After each of the following petitions, the choir sings:

Lord, have mercy three times.

In parish churches:

Again we pray for our holy father, (Name), Pope of Rome,
and for our most reverend Archbishop and Metropolitan
(Name), for our God-loving Bishop (Name), for those who
serve and have served in this holy church, for our spiritual
fathers, and for all our brothers and sisters in Christ.

In monasteries:

Again we pray for our holy father (Name), Pope
of Rome, and for our most reverend Archbishop and
Metropolitan (Name), for our God-loving Bishop (Name),
for our most venerable hieromonks: Proto-archimandrite
(Name), Archimandrite (Name), Proto-hegumen (Name), and
Hegumen (Name), for those who serve and have served in
this holy monastery, for our spiritual fathers, and for all our
brothers and sisters in Christ.

Again we pray for our government (or for our God-
protected Emperor or King whose realm it is Name for his
health and salvation) and for all in the service of our country.

Again we pray for the people here present who await Your
great and abundant mercy, for those who show us mercy, and
for all Christians of the true faith.

The priest exclaims:

For You are a merciful God and You love mankind, and
we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and
ever and forever.
Choir: Amen.

But the Choir: Give the blessing.

Priest: Blessed is Christ our God, the One-Who-Is,

always, now and ever and forever.

Choir: Amen.

And immediately the First Hour is read. At the conclusion

of the First Hour, the priest makes the solemn dismissal.
_________________________________________________

If it is the Forty Day Fast:

It is good to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises
to Your Name, O most High. To proclaim Your mercy in the
morning, and Your faithfulness throughout the night. Twice.

Trisagion. Most Holy Trinity: After Our Father: the

priest: For Thine is the kingdom:

And we say:

Standing in the temple of Your glory is like standing in
heaven itself. O Theotokos and gate of heaven, open for us the
doors of your mercy.

Then, Lord, have mercy. Forty times. Master, give the

blessing.

The priest:

Blessed is Christ our God, the One-Who-Is, always, now

and ever and forever.
Choir: Amen.

The priest:

Heavenly King, strengthen our government (or our God-
protected Emperor or our King Name), confirm the faith, calm
the nations, give peace to the world, preserve well this city
(or village, or this holy monastery). Grant our fathers and
brothers and sisters who have departed before us repose in the
abode of the just, and accept us in repentance and confession,
for You are good and love mankind.

Choir: Amen. Lord, have mercy. Three times. Glory: now

and ever:

More honorable than the cherubim, and beyond compare
more glorious than the seraphim; who, a virgin, gave birth to
God the Word, you, truly the Theotokos, we magnify.

Give the blessing, Father, in the Name of the Lord.

The priest:

Through the prayers of our holy fathers, O Lord Jesus

Christ, our God, have mercy on us.

Choir: Amen.

The priest reads the prayer of Saint Ephrem the Syrian:

Lord and Master of my life, spare me from the spirit
of indifference, despair, lust for power, and idle chatter.
Prostration.

Instead, bestow on me, your servant, the spirit of integrity,

humility, patience and love. Prostration.

Yes, O Lord and King, let me see my own sins, and not
judge my brothers and sisters, for You are blessed, forever and
ever. Amen. Prostration.

O God, be merciful to me, a sinner. Bow.
O God, cleanse me of my sins and have mercy on me.

Bow.

O Lord, forgive me for I have sinned without number.

Bow.

And again the entire prayer of Saint Ephrem with one

prostration after its conclusion.

And after the prostrations, the First Hour.
