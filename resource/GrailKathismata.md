From the 1963 Psalter.

# The First Kathisma

Psalms 1–8

## Psalm 1

Psalm 1(1) Beatus vir qui non abiit[001]()

 1 Happy indeed is the man <br>
 who follows not the counsel of the wicked, <br>
 nor lingers in the way of sinners <br>
 nor sits in the company of scorners, <br>
 2 but whose delight is the law of the Lord <br>
 and who ponders his law day and night. <br>
 3 He is like a tree that is planted <br>
 beside the flowing waters, <br>
 that yields its fruit in due season <br>
 and whose leaves shall never fade; <br>
 and all that he does shall prosper. <br>
 4 Not so are the wicked, not so! <br>
 For they like winnowed chaff <br>
 shall be driven away by the wind. <br>
 5 When the wicked are judged they shall not stand, <br>
 nor find room among those who are just; <br>
 6 f or the Lord guards the way of the just <br>
 but the way of the wicked leads to doom.

## Psalm 2

Psalm 2(2) Quare fremuerunt gentes[002]()

 1 Why this tumult among nations, <br>
 among peoples this useless murmuring? <br>
 2 They arise, the kings of the earth, <br>
 princes plot against the Lord and his Anointed. <br>
 3 “Come, let us break their fetters, <br>
 come, let us cast off their yoke.” <br>
 4 He who sits in the heavens laughs; <br>
 the Lord is laughing them to scorn. <br>
 5 Then he will speak in his anger, <br>
 his rage will strike them with terror. <br>
 6 “It is I who have set up my king <br>
 on Zion, my holy mountain.” <br>
 7 (I will announce the decree of the Lord:) <br>
 The Lord said to me: “You are my Son. <br>
 It is I who have begotten you this day. <br>
 8 Ask and I will shall bequeath you the nations, <br>
 put the ends of the earth in your possession. <br>
 9 With a rod of iron you will break them, <br>
 shatter them like a potter’s jar.” <br>
 10 Now, O kings, understand, <br>
 take warning, rulers of the earth; <br>
 11 serve the Lord with awe <br>
 and trembling, pay him your homage <br>
 12 lest he be angry and you perish; <br>
 for suddenly his anger will blaze. <br>
 Blessed are they who put their trust in God.

## Psalm 3

Psalm 3(3) Domine, quid multiplicati[003]()

 2 How many are my foes, O Lord! <br>
 How many are rising up against me! <br>
 3 How many are saying about me: <br>
 “There is no help for him in God.” <br>
 4 But you, Lord, are a shield about me, <br>
 my glory, who lift up my head. <br>
 5 I cry aloud to the Lord. <br>
 He answers from his holy mountain. <br>
 6 I lie down to rest, and I sleep. <br>
 I wake, for the Lord upholds me. <br>
 7 I will not fear even thousands of people <br>
 who are ranged on every side against me. <br>
 8 Arise, Lord; save me, my God, <br>
 you who strike my foes on the mouth, <br>
 you who break the teeth of the wicked! <br>
 9 O Lord of salvation, bless your people!

## Psalm 4

Psalm 4(4) Cum invocarem[004]()

 2 When I call, answer me, O God of justice; <br>
 from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me! <br>
 3 O men, how long will your hearts be closed, <br>
 will you love what is futile and seek what is false? <br>
 4 It is the Lord who grants favors to those whom he loves; <br>
 the Lord hears me whenever I call him. <br>
 5 Fear him; do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still <br>
 6 Make justice your sacrifice, and trust in the Lord. <br>
 7 “What can bring us happiness?” many say. <br>
 Lift up the light of your face on us, O Lord. <br>
 8 You have put into my heart a greater joy <br>
 than they have from abundance of corn and new wine. <br>
 9 I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once <br>
 for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.

## Psalm 5

Psalm 5(5) Verba mea auribus[005]()

 2 To my words give ear, O Lord, <br>
 give heed to my groaning. <br>
 3 Attend to the sound of my cries, <br>
 my King and my God. <br>
 /.4 It is you whom I invoke, O Lord. <br>
 In the morning you hear me; <br>
 in the morning I offer you my prayer, <br>
 watching and waiting. <br>
 5 You are no God who loves evil; <br>
 no sinner is your guest. <br>
 6 The boastful shall not stand their ground <br>
 before your face. <br>
 7 You hate all who do evil; <br>
 you destroy all who lie. <br>
 The deceitful and bloodthirsty man <br>
 the Lord detests. <br>
 8 But I through the greatness of your love <br>
 have access to your house. <br>
 I bow down before your holy temple, <br>
 filled with awe. <br>
 9 Lead me, Lord, in your justice, <br>
 because of those who lie in wait; <br>
 make clear your way before me. <br>
 10 No truth can be found in their mouths, <br>
 their heart is all mischief, <br>
 their throat a wide-open grave, <br>
 all honey their speech. <br>
 11 Declare them guilty, O God. <br>
 Let them fail in their designs. <br>
 Drive them out for their many offenses, <br>
 for they have defied you. <br>
 12 All those you protect shall be glad <br>
 and ring out their joy. <br>
 You shelter them; in you they rejoice, <br>
 those who love your name. <br>
 13 It is you who bless the just man <br>
 you surround him with favor as with a shield.

## Psalm 6

Psalm 6(6) Domine, ne in furore[006]()

 2 Lord, do not reprove me in your anger; <br>
 punish me not in your rage. <br>
 3 Have mercy on me, Lord, I have no strength; <br>
 Lord, heal me, my body is racked; <br>
 4 my soul is racked with pain. <br>
 But you, O Lord...how long? <br>
 5 Return, Lord, rescue my soul. <br>
 Save me in your merciful love; <br>
 6 for in death no one remembers you; <br>
 from the grave, who can give you praise? <br>
 7 I am exhausted with my groaning; <br>
 every night I drench my pillow with tears; <br>
 I bedew my bed with weeping. <br>
 8 My eye wastes away with grief; <br>
 I have grown old surrounded by my foes. <br>
 9 Leave me, all you who do evil; <br>
 for the Lord has heard my weeping. <br>
 10 The Lord has heard my plea; <br>
 The Lord will accept my prayer. <br>
 11 All my foes will retire in confusion, <br>
 foiled and suddenly confounded.

## Psalm 7

Psalm 7(7) Domine, Deus meus[007]()

 2 Lord God, I take refuge in you. <br>
 From my pursuer save me and rescue me, <br>
 3 lest he tear me to pieces like a lion <br>
 and drag me off with no one to rescue me. <br>
 4 Lord God, if my hands have done wrong, <br>
 5 if I have paid back evil for good, <br>
 I who saved my unjust oppressor: <br>
 6 then let my foe pursue me and seize me, <br>
 let him trample my life to the ground <br>
 and lay my soul in the dust. <br>

* * * <br>

 7 Lord, rise up in your anger, <br>
 rise against the fury of my foes; <br>
 my God, awake! You will give judgment. <br>
 8 Let the company of nations gather round you, <br>
 taking your seat above them on high. <br>
 9 (The Lord is judge of the peoples.) <br>
 Give judgment for me, Lord; I am just <br>
 and innocent of heart. <br>
 10 Put an end to the evil of the wicked! <br>
 Make the just stand firm, <br>
 you who test mind and heart, <br>
 O just God! <br>
 11 God is the shield that protects me, <br>
 who saves the upright of heart. <br>
 12 God is a just judge <br>
 slow to anger; <br>
 but he threatens the wicked every day, <br>
 13 men who will not repent. <br>

* * * <br>

 God will sharpen his sword; <br>
 he has braced his bow and taken aim. <br>
 14 For them he has prepared deadly weapons; <br>
 he barbs his arrows with fire. <br>
 15 Here is one who is pregnant with malice, <br>
 who conceives evil and brings forth lies. <br>
 16 He digs a pitfall, digs it deep; <br>
 and in the trap he has made he will fall. <br>
 17 His malice will recoil on himself; <br>
 on his own head his violence will fall. <br>

* * * <br>

 18 I will thank the Lord for his justice: <br>
 I will sing to the Lord, the Most High.

## Psalm 8

Psalm 8(8) Domine, Dominus noster[008]()

 2 How great is your name, O Lord our God, <br>
 through all the earth! <br>
 Your majesty is praised above the heavens; <br>
 3 on the lips of children and of babes <br>
 you have found praise to foil your enemy, <br>
 to silence the foe and the rebel. <br>
 4 When I see the heavens, the work of your hands, <br>
 the moon and the stars which you arranged, <br>
 5 what is man that you should keep him in mind, <br>
 mortal man that you care for him? <br>
 6 Yet you have made him little less than a god; <br>
 with glory and honor you crowned him, <br>
 7 gave him power over the works of your hands, <br>
 put all things under his feet. <br>
 8 All of them, sheep and cattle, <br>
 yes, even the savage beasts, <br>
 9 birds of the air, and fish <br>
 that make their way through the waters. <br>
 10 How great is your name, O Lord our God <br>
 through all the earth!

# The Second Kathisma

Psalms 9–16 (Greek: including Hebrew Psalm 17 as Greek 16)

## Psalm 9

Psalm 9(9.1) Confitebor tibi[009]()

 2 I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart; <br>
 I will recount all your wonders. <br>
 3 I will rejoice in you and be glad, <br>
 and sing psalms to your name, O Most High. <br>
 4 See how my enemies turn back, <br>
 how they stumble and perish before you. <br>
 5 You upheld the justice of my cause; <br>
 you sat enthroned, judging with justice. <br>
 6 You have checked the nations, destroyed the wicked; <br>
 you have wiped out their name for ever and ever. <br>
 7 The foe is destroyed, eternally ruined. <br>
 You uprooted their cities; their memory has perished. <br>
 8 But the Lord sits enthroned for ever. <br>
 He has set up his throne for judgment; <br>
 9 he will judge the world with justice, <br>
 he will judge the peoples with his truth. <br>
 10 For the oppressed let the Lord be a stronghold, <br>
 a stronghold in times of distress. <br>
 11 Those who know your name will trust you; <br>
 you will never forsake those who seek you. <br>
 12 Sing psalms to the Lord who dwells in Zion. <br>
 Proclaim his mighty works among the peoples, <br>
 13 for the Avenger of blood has remembered them, <br>
 has not forgotten the cry of the poor. <br>
 14 Have pity on me, Lord, see my sufferings, <br>
 you who save me from the gates of death; <br>
 15 that I may recount all your praise <br>
 at the gates of the city of Zion <br>
 and rejoice in your saving help. <br>
 16 The nations have fallen in the pit which they made, <br>
 their feet caught in the snare they laid. <br>
 17 The Lord has revealed himself, and given judgment. <br>
 The wicked are snared in the work of their own hands. <br>
 18 Let the wicked go down among the dead, <br>
 all the nations forgetful of God; <br>
 19 for the needy shall not always be forgotten <br>
 nor the hopes of the poor be in vain. <br>
 20 Arise, Lord, let men not prevail! <br>
 Let the nations be judged before you. <br>
 21 Lord, strike them with terror, <br>
 let the nations know they are but men.

## Psalm 10

Psalm 10(9.2) Ut quid Domine[010]()

 1 Lord, why do you stand afar off <br>
 and hide yourself in times of distress? <br>
 2 The poor man is devoured by the pride of the wicked: <br>
 he is caught in the schemes that others have made. <br>
 3 For the wicked man boasts of his heart’s desires; <br>
 the covetous blasphemes and spurns the Lord. <br>
 4 In his pride the wicked says: “He will not punish. <br>
 There is no God.” Such are his thoughts. <br>
 5 His path is ever untroubled; <br>
 your judgment is far from his mind. <br>
 His enemies he regards with contempt. <br>
 6 He thinks: “Never shall I falter: <br>
 misfortune shall never be my lot.” <br>
 7 His mouth is full of cursing, guile, oppression; <br>
 mischief and deceit are under his tongue. <br>
 8 He lies in wait among the reeds; <br>
 the innocent he murders in secret. <br>
 His eyes are on the watch for the helpless man. <br>
 9 He lurks in hiding like a lion in his lair; <br>
 he lurks in hiding to seize the poor; <br>
 he seizes the poor man and drags him away. <br>
 10 He crouches, preparing to spring, <br>
 and the helpless fall beneath such strength. <br>
 11 He thinks in his heart: “God forgets, <br>
 he hides his face, he does not see.” <br>
 12 Arise then, Lord, lift up your hand! <br>
 O God, do not forget the poor! <br>
 13 Why should the wicked spurn the Lord <br>
 and think in his heart: “God will not punish”? <br>
 14 But you have seen the trouble and sorrow, <br>
 you note it, you take it in hand. <br>
 The helpless trusts himself to you; <br>
 for you are the helper of the orphan. <br>
 15 Break the power of the wicked and the sinner! <br>
 Punish their wickedness till nothing remains! <br>
 16 The Lord is king for ever and ever. <br>
 The heathen shall perish from the land he rules. <br>
 17 Lord, you hear the prayer of the poor; <br>
 you strengthen their hearts; you turn your ear <br>
 18 to protect the rights of the orphan and oppressed: <br>
 so that mortal man may strike terror no more.

## Psalm 11

Psalm 11(10) In Domine confido[011]()

 1 In the Lord I have taken my refuge. <br>
 How can you say to my soul: <br>
 “Fly like a bird to its mountain. <br>
 2 See the wicked bracing their bow; <br>
 they are fixing their arrows on the string <br>
 to shoot upright men in the dark. <br>
 3 Foundations once destroyed, what can the just do?” <br>
 4 The Lord is in his holy temple, <br>
 the Lord, whose throne is in heaven. <br>
 His eyes look down on the world; <br>
 his gaze tests mortal men. <br>
 5 The Lord tests the just and the wicked; <br>
 the lover of violence he hates. <br>
 6 He sends fire and brimstone on the wicked; <br>
 he sends a scorching wind as their lot. <br>
 7 The Lord is just and loves justice; <br>
 the upright shall see his face.

## Psalm 12

Psalm 12(11) Salva me fac[012]()

 2 Help, O Lord, for good men have vanished; <br>
 truth has gone from the sons of men. <br>
 3 Falsehood they speak one to another, <br>
 with lying lips, with a false heart. <br>
 4 May the Lord destroy all lying lips, <br>
 the tongue that speaks high-sounding words, <br>
 5 those who say: “Our tongue is our strength; <br>
 our lips are our own, who is our master?” <br>
 6 “For the poor who are oppressed and the needy who groan <br>
 I myself will arise,” says the Lord, <br>
 “I will grant them the salvation for which they thirst.” <br>
 7 The words of the Lord are words without alloy, <br>
 silver from the furnace, seven times refined. <br>
 8 It is you, O Lord, who will take us in your care <br>
 and protect us for ever from this generation. <br>
 9 See how the wicked prowl on every side, <br>
 while the worthless are prized highly by the sons of men.

## Psalm 13

Psalm 13(12) Usquequo, Domine?[013]()

 2 How long, O Lord, will you forget me? <br>
 How long will you hide your face? <br>
 3 How long must I bear grief in my soul, <br>
 this sorrow in my heart day and night? <br>
 How long shall my enemy prevail? <br>
 4 Look at me, answer me, Lord my God! <br>
 Give light to my eyes lest I fall asleep in death, <br>
 5 lest my enemy say: “I have overcome him”; <br>
 lest my foes rejoice to see my fall. <br>
 6 As for me, I trust in your merciful love. <br>
 Let my heart rejoice in your saving help: <br>
 7 Let me sing to the Lord for his goodness to me, <br>
 singing psalms to the name of the Lord, the Most High.

## Psalm 14

Psalm 14(13) Dixit insipiens[014]()

 1 The fool has said in his heart: <br>
 “There is no God above.” <br>
 Their deeds are corrupt, depraved; <br>
 not a good man is left. <br>
 2 From heaven the Lord looks down <br>
 on the sons of men <br>
 to see if any are wise, <br>
 if any seek God. <br>
 3 All have left the right path, <br>
 depraved, every one; <br>
 there is not a good man left, <br>
 no, not even one. <br>
 4 Will the evil-doers not understand? <br>
 They eat up my people <br>
 as though they were eating bread: <br>
 they never pray to the Lord. <br>
 5 See how they tremble with fear <br>
 without cause for fear: <br>
 for God is with the just. <br>
 6 You may mock the poor man’s hope, <br>
 but his refuge is the Lord. <br>
 7 O that Israel’s salvation might come from Zion! <br>
 When the Lord delivers his people from bondage, <br>
 then Jacob will be glad and Israel rejoice.

## Psalm 15

Psalm 15(14) Domine, quis habitabit?[015]()

 1 Lord, who shall be admitted to your tent <br>
 and dwell on your holy mountain? <br>
 2 He who walks without fault; <br>
 he who acts with justice <br>
 and speaks the truth from his heart; <br>
 3 he who does not slander with his tongue; <br>
 He who does no wrong to his brother, <br>
 who casts no slur on his neighbor, <br>
 4 who holds the godless in disdain, <br>
 but honors those who fear the Lord; <br>
 he who keeps his pledge, come what may; <br>
 5 who takes no interest on a loan <br>
 and accepts no bribes against the innocent. <br>
 Such a man will stand firm forever.

## Psalm 16

Psalm 16(15) Conserva me, Domine[016]()

 1 Preserve me, God, I take refuge in you. <br>
 2 I say to the Lord: “You are my God. <br>
 My happiness lies in you alone.” <br>
 3 He has put into my heart a marvelous love <br>
 for the faithful ones who dwell in his land. <br>
 4 Those who choose other gods increase their sorrows. <br>
 Never will I offer their offerings of blood. <br>
 Never will I take their name upon my lips. <br>
 5 O Lord, it is you who are my portion and cup; <br>
 it is you yourself who are my prize. <br>
 6 The lot marked out for me is my delight: <br>
 welcome indeed the heritage that falls to me! <br>
 7 I will bless the Lord who gives me counsel, <br>
 who even at night directs my heart. <br>
 8 I keep the Lord ever in my sight: <br>
 since he is at my right hand, I shall stand firm. <br>
 9 And so my heart rejoices, my soul is glad; <br>
 even my body shall rest in safety. <br>
 10 For you will not leave my soul among the dead, <br>
 nor let your beloved know decay. <br>
 11 You will show me the path of life, <br>
 the fullness of joy in your presence, <br>
 at your right hand happiness for ever.

## Psalm 17 (Greek 16)

Psalm 17(16) Exaudi Domine[017]()

 1 Listen to my prayer for justice, O God. <br>
 Pay heed to my upright cause. <br>
 Lend a listening ear to my appeal: <br>
 no guilt is on my lips. <br>
 2 From you may my judgment come forth: <br>
 your eyes discern what is right. <br>
 3 You have tested my heart, searched my soul in the night, <br>
 tried me by fire, and you have seen no malice in me. <br>
 4 As for men’s words, I have kept far from the paths of the violent, <br>
 held to your words, O Lord. <br>
 5 I keep my steps on your paths: <br>
 my feet have made no faltering. <br>
 6 I call upon you, God, for you will answer me; <br>
 turn your ear and hear my words. <br>
 7 Show clearly your wonderful mercy, <br>
 you savior of those who hope in you <br>
 from the foes that rise against them. <br>
 8 Keep me as the apple of your eye. <br>
 Hide me in the shadow of your wings <br>
 9 from the wicked who despoil me. <br>
 My enemies surround me, <br>
 10 shut off their callous hearts, <br>
 open wide their mouths and speak with pride. <br>
 11 They advance against me, and now they surround me. <br>
 Their eyes are ready to bring me down to the ground; <br>
 12 like a lion greedy for its prey, <br>
 like a young lion crouching in ambush. <br>
 13 Arise, Lord, confront them and bring them down; <br>
 rescue my soul from the wicked with your sword. <br>
 14 With your hand, O Lord, rescue me from men, <br>
 from men whose life is fleeting as a breath. <br>
 Let their morning be pillage, and at evening let them be no more; <br>
 let their possessions be shared out among themselves. <br>
 15 But I will appear before you in justice; <br>
 my sight shall be filled with the vision of your glory. <br>

## Psalm 18

Psalm 18(17) Diligam te Domine[018]()

 2 I love you, Lord, my strength. <br>
 3 Lord, my rock, my fortress, my savior, <br>
 my God, my rock where I take refuge, <br>
 my shield, my saving strength, my stronghold. <br>
 4 I cry out, “Praised be the Lord!” <br>
 and see, I am saved from my foes. <br>
 5 The breakers of death surrounded me, <br>
 the torrents of destruction assailed me; <br>
 6 the bonds of the underworld encompassed me, <br>
 the snares of death confronted me. <br>
 7 In my distress I called upon the Lord, <br>
 cried out to my God for help. <br>
 From his temple he heard my voice; <br>
 my cry to him reached his ears. <br>
 8 The earth then reeled and rocked; <br>
 the mountains were shaken to their base; <br>
 they quaked at his terrible anger. <br>
 9 Smoke came forth from his nostrils, <br>
 and scorching fire from his mouth; <br>
 from him were kindled live coals. <br>
 10 He bent the heavens and came down, <br>
 a dark cloud was under his feet. <br>
 11 On a cherub he rode and he flew, <br>
 he soared on the wings of the wind. <br>
 12 He made the darkness his covering, <br>
 the dark waters of the clouds, his tent. <br>
 13 A brightness shone out before him, <br>
 with hailstones and flashes of fire. <br>
 14 The Lord then thundered in the heavens, <br>
 the Most High let his voice be heard, <br>
 with hail and coals of fire. <br>
 15 He shot his arrows, scattered the foes, <br>
 flashed his lightnings, and put them to flight. <br>
 16 The bed of the ocean was revealed; <br>
 the foundations of the world were laid bare <br>
 at your rebuke, O Lord, <br>
 at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. <br>
 17 From on high he reached down and seized me; <br>
 he drew me forth from the mighty waters. <br>
 18 He saved me from my powerful foe, <br>
 from enemies too strong for me. <br>
 19 They assailed me in the day of my misfortune, <br>
 but the Lord was my stay. <br>
 20 He freed me from going down to the pit, <br>
 brought me out to a spacious place. <br>
 21 The Lord repaid me according to my justice, <br>
 according to the innocence of my hands he recompensed me, <br>
 22 for I have kept the ways of the Lord, <br>
 and not fallen away from my God. <br>
 23 For his judgments are all before me, <br>
 his laws I have not cast from me; <br>
 24 I have been blameless before him, <br>
 and have kept myself from guilt. <br>
 25 The Lord will repay me according to my justice, <br>
 according to the innocence of my hands before his eyes. <br>
 26 With the loyal you are loyal, <br>
 with the blameless you are blameless; <br>
 27 with the sincere you are sincere, <br>
 but with the cunning you are cunning; <br>
 28 you save a lowly people, <br>
 but bring low the eyes that are haughty. <br>
 29 You, Lord, are my lamp; <br>
 the Lord illumines my darkness. <br>
 30 With you I can break through a barricade, <br>
 with my God I can scale a rampart. <br>
 31 God’s way is perfect, <br>
 the word of the Lord is flawless. <br>
 He is a shield for all who take refuge in him. <br>
 32 For who is God but the Lord? <br>
 Who is a rock but our God? <br>
 33 God, who girded me with might, <br>
 kept my path free from blame. <br>
 34 He made my feet as swift as the hinds’, <br>
 set me firm on the heights. <br>
 35 He trained my hands for battle, <br>
 made my arms bend the bronze bow. <br>
 36 You gave me your saving shield; <br>
 your right hand held me fast, <br>
 your care made me great. <br>
 37 You spread a broad path for my feet, <br>
 no trace of faltering in my steps. <br>
 38 I pursued my foes and overtook them; <br>
 I did not turn back till they were destroyed. <br>
 39 I struck them down, and they did not rise; <br>
 they fell, dead, at my feet. <br>
 40 You girded me with strength for battle, <br>
 made my foes lie down beneath me. <br>
 41 You made my enemies turn tail, <br>
 my foes, and I destroyed them. <br>
 42 They cried, but there was no one to save them; <br>
 they cried to the Lord, but he gave no answer. <br>
 43 I beat them fine as the dust in the wind; <br>
 I trampled them down like the mud in the streets. <br>
 44 You rescued me from the strife of peoples, <br>
 made me head of the nations; <br>
 a people I had not known became my servants. <br>
 45 Foreigners cringed before me, <br>
 as soon as they heard me they obeyed me. <br>
 46 They lost heart, and came trembling from their fortresses. <br>
 47 The Lord lives; blessed be my rock! <br>
 Let the God of my salvation be exalted! <br>
 48 The God who grants me vindication, <br>
 who subdues peoples under me, <br>
 49 who frees me from my enemies— <br>
 You exalt me above my adversaries, <br>
 from violent men you rescue me. <br>
 50 For this, Lord, I will praise you among the nations, <br>
 and sing psalms to your name. <br>
 51 He saves his king, time after time, <br>
 shows his love for his anointed, <br>
 for David and his sons forever.

## Psalm 19

Psalm 19(18) Caeli enarrant[019]()

 2 The heavens proclaim the glory of God, <br>
 and the firmament shows forth the work of his hands. <br>
 3 Day to day utters that word, <br>
 and night to night imparts knowledge. <br>
 4 No speech, no word, no voice is heard <br>
 5 yet their voice goes forth through all the earth, <br>
 their message to the ends of the world. <br>
 There he has pitched a tent for the sun, <br>
 6 which comes forth like a bridegroom coming from his tent, <br>
 rejoices like a champion to run its course. <br>
 7 At one end of the heavens is the rising of the sun; <br>
 to the other end it runs its course. <br>
 There is nothing concealed from its burning heat. <br>
 8 The law of the Lord is perfect, <br>
 it revives the soul. <br>
 The rule of the Lord is to be trusted, <br>
 it gives wisdom to the simple. <br>
 9 The precepts of the Lord are right, <br>
 they gladden the heart. <br>
 The command of the Lord is clear, <br>
 it gives light to the eyes. <br>
 10 The fear of the Lord is holy, <br>
 abiding for ever. <br>
 The decrees of the Lord are truth <br>
 and all of them just. <br>
 11 So in them your servant finds instruction; <br>
 great reward is in their keeping. <br>
 12 But who can detect one’s own failings? <br>
 From hidden faults acquit me. <br>
 13 From presumption restrain your servant, <br>
 may it never rule over me. <br>
 Then I shall be blameless, <br>
 clean from grave sin. <br>
 14 May the spoken words of my mouth, <br>
 the thoughts of my heart, <br>
 win favor in your sight, <br>
 O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer!

## Psalm 20

Psalm 20(19) Exaudiat te Dominus[020]()

 2 May the Lord answer you in the day of trial; <br>
 may the name of the God of Jacob protect you. <br>
 3 May he send you help from the sanctuary, <br>
 give you support from Zion; <br>
 4 may he remember all your offerings <br>
 and regard with favor your sacrifice. <br>
 5 May he give you your heart’s desire, <br>
 fulfill all your plans. <br>
 6 May we ring out our joy at your victory, <br>
 and exult in the name of our God. <br>
 May the Lord fulfill all your petitions, <br>
 7 now I know that the Lord saves his anointed. <br>
 He will answer him from his holy heaven <br>
 with the mighty victory of his right hand. <br>
 8 Some trust in chariots or horses, <br>
 but we in the name of the Lord our God. <br>
 9 They will collapse and fall, <br>
 but we shall rise and stand upright. <br>
 10 Give victory to the king, O Lord, <br>
 give answer on the day we call.

## Psalm 21

Psalm 21(20) Domine in virtute tua[021]()

 2 In your strength, O Lord, the king rejoices; <br>
 how greatly your help makes him glad! <br>
 3 You have granted him his heart’s desire, <br>
 have not withheld the prayer of his lips. <br>
 4 For you welcome him with goodly blessings, <br>
 set on his head a crown of pure gold. <br>
 5 He asked of you life, and this you have given, <br>
 days that will last from age to age. <br>
 6 By your saving help great is his glory; <br>
 you bestow on him majesty and splendor; <br>
 7 you make blessings for ever his lot, <br>
 fill him with the joy of your presence. <br>
 8 For the king puts his trust in the Lord; <br>
 through the grace of the Most High he will not fall. <br>
 9 Your hand will find out all your foes, <br>
 your right hand find out those who hate you. <br>
 10 You make them like a fiery furnace <br>
 at the time of your anger. <br>
 The Lord will swallow them in his wrath <br>
 and fire will devour them. <br>
 11 Their offspring you will wipe from the earth, <br>
 their descendants from the sons of men. <br>
 12 Though they planned evil against you, <br>
 though they plotted, they shall not succeed; <br>
 13 for you will put them to flight, <br>
 aim your shafts against them. <br>
 14 Be exalted, Lord, in your strength; <br>
 we will sing and praise your power.

## Psalm 22

Psalm 22(21) Deus Deus meus[022]()

 2 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? <br>
 You are far from my plea and my cry’s answer. <br>
 3 O my God, I cry to you by day, <br>
 but you do not answer; <br>
 by night, yet I find no relief. <br>
 4 Yet you, holy one, <br>
 are enthroned on the praises of Israel. <br>
 5 In you our fathers put their trust; <br>
 they trusted, and you set them free. <br>
 6 To you they cried, and were saved; <br>
 in you they trusted, and were not confounded. <br>
 7 But I am a worm and no man, <br>
 scorned by all, despised by the people. <br>
 8 All who see me deride me. <br>
 They curl their lips, toss their heads, <br>
 9 “He trusted in the Lord, let him save him; <br>
 let him release him, for in him he delights.” <br>
 10 Yes, it was you who took me from my mother’s womb, <br>
 entrusted me to her breasts when I was born; <br>
 11 from my mother’s womb you have been my God. <br>
 12 Do not leave me alone in my distress, <br>
 for trouble is near and there is no one to help. <br>
 13 Many bulls have surrounded me, <br>
 fierce bulls of Bashan close me in. <br>
 14 Against me they open wide their jaws, <br>
 like lions rending and roaring. <br>
 15 Like water I am poured out, <br>
 disjointed are all my bones. <br>
 My heart has become like wax, <br>
 it is melted within my breast. <br>
 16 Parched as burnt clay is my throat, <br>
 my tongue cleaves to my jaws. <br>
 You lay me in the dust of death. <br>
 17 For dogs have surrounded me; <br>
 a band of the wicked beset me. <br>
 They have pierced my hands and my feet: <br>
 18 I can count all my bones. <br>
 They stare at me and gloat; <br>
 19 they divide my garments among them <br>
 and cast lots for my clothing. <br>
 20 But you, Lord, do not stay afar off. <br>
 My strength, hasten to my aid; <br>
 21 rescue my soul from the sword, <br>
 my life from the grip of the dog. <br>
 22 Save my life from the jaws of the lion; <br>
 from the horns of the wild bulls, my poor soul. <br>
 23 I will tell of your name to my brethren; <br>
 in the midst of the assembly I will praise you: <br>
 24 “You who fear the Lord, give him praise; <br>
 all you offspring of Jacob, give him glory. <br>
 Revere him, Israel’s offspring all. <br>
 25 For he has not spurned or disregarded <br>
 the misery of the poor man, <br>
 has not hidden his face from him, <br>
 but has heard him when he cried.” <br>
 26 My praise for you is sung in the great assembly. <br>
 My vows I will fulfill before those who fear him. <br>
 27 The poor shall eat and shall have their fill. <br>
 They shall praise the Lord, who seek him. <br>
 May their hearts live for ever. <br>
 28 All the earth shall remember and return to the Lord, <br>
 all families of the nations worship before him; <br>
 29 for the kingdom is the Lord’s, he is ruler over the nations. <br>
 30 To him alone shall bow down the proud of the earth; <br>
 before him shall bend all who go down to the dust. <br>
 31 And my soul shall live for him, <br>
 my children serve him. <br>
 They shall tell of the Lord to generations yet to come, <br>
 declare his faithfulness to a people yet unborn: <br>
 “These things the Lord has done.”

## Psalm 23

Psalm 23(22) Dominus regit me[023]()

 1 The Lord is my shepherd; <br>
 there is nothing I shall want. <br>
 2 Fresh and green are the pastures <br>
 where he gives me repose. <br>
 Near restful waters he leads me, <br>
 3 to reviving waters he leads me; <br>
 he restores my soul. <br>
 He guides me along sure paths, <br>
 as he himself has chosen. <br>
 4 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death <br>
 I fear no evil, for you are with me. <br>
 Your crook and your staff are there by to comfort me. <br>
 5 You have prepared a banquet for me <br>
 in the sight of my foes. <br>
 My head you have anointed with oil; <br>
 my cup is overflowing. <br>
 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me <br>
 all the days of my life. <br>
 In the Lord’s own house shall I dwell <br>
 for ever and ever.

## Psalm 24

Psalm 24(23) Domine, quid multiplicati[024]()

 1 To you our praise is due in Sion, O God. <br>
 To you we pay our vows in Jerusalem, <br>
 2 who hear our prayer. <br>
 To you all flesh will come; <br>
 3 our sins overwhelm us, <br>
 but you forgive our faults. <br>
 4 Happy the man you choose, <br>
 whom you call to dwell in your courts. <br>
 May we be filled with the blessings of your house, <br>
 of your holy temple. <br>
 5 With awe-inspiring deeds of justice you answer us, <br>
 O God our savior, <br>
 the hope of all the ends of the earth <br>
 and of those far across the seas. <br>
 6 You set the mountains in place by your power, <br>
 you who are girded with might; <br>
 7 you still the roaring of the seas, <br>
 (the roaring of their waves) <br>
 and the tumult of the peoples. <br>
 8 The dwellers in the furthest regions <br>
 stand in awe at your marvels. <br>
 From your rising to your sunset, <br>
 cries of joy arise. <br>
 9 You care for the earth, give it water, <br>
 you fill it with riches. <br>
 Your river in heaven brims over <br>
 to provide the earth with its grain. <br>
 10 And thus you provide for the earth; <br>
 you drench its furrows, <br>
 you level it, soften it with showers, <br>
 you bless its growth. <br>
 11 You crown the year with your bounty. <br>
 Abundance flows in your wake, <br>
 12 and your paths overflow with plenty. <br>
 13 May the pastures of the wilderness also flower, <br>
 and the hills be girded with joy; <br>
 14 may the fields be clothed with flocks, <br>
 the valleys be covered with corn. <br>
 Then shall they shout for joy and sing, <br>
 “All blessings on the Lord!”

# The Fourth Kathisma

Psalms 24–31 (Greek numbering)

## Psalm 24

Psalm 25(24) Ad te, Domine, levavi[025]()

 1 To you I lift up my soul, O Lord; <br>
 2 in you I trust, my God. <br>
 Let me not be put to shame; <br>
 let not my enemies exult over me. <br>
 3 No one who hopes in you will be put to shame; <br>
 but shame will come to those <br>
 who for no reason are faithless. <br>
 4 Make known to me your ways, O Lord; <br>
 teach me your paths. <br>
 5 Steadfastly guide me in your truth <br>
 and teach me; <br>
 for you are the God of my salvation; <br>
 all day long for you I wait. <br>
 6 Remember your compassion, Lord, <br>
 and your merciful love, for they are from of old. <br>
 7 Do not remember the sins of my youth <br>
 or my transgressions; <br>
 in your merciful love remember me, <br>
 because of your goodness, O Lord. <br>
 8 Good and upright is the Lord; <br>
 he teaches sinners the way. <br>
 9 He guides the humble in right judgment, <br>
 to the humble he teaches his way. <br>
 10 All the Lord’s paths are mercy and faithfulness, <br>
 for those who keep his covenant and decrees. <br>
 11 For your name’s sake, O Lord, <br>
 pardon my guilt, for it is great. <br>
 12 Who is it that fears the Lord? <br>
 He will show him the way to choose. <br>
 13 His soul shall live in happiness; <br>
 his offspring shall possess the land. <br>
 14 The Lord becomes intimate with those who fear him; <br>
 he reveals to them his covenant. <br>
 15 My eyes are always on the Lord, <br>
 for he rescues my feet from the snare. <br>
 16 Turn to me and have mercy, <br>
 for I am alone and poor. <br>
 17 Relieve the anguish of my heart, <br>
 and set me free from my distress. <br>
 18 See my lowliness and my toil, <br>
 and pardon all my sins. <br>
 19 See how many are my foes, <br>
 how my enemies hate me with a violent hatred. <br>
 20 Preserve my life and rescue me. <br>
 Let me not be put to shame, for in you I trust. <br>
 21 Integrity and uprightness be with me, <br>
 for my hope is in you. <br>
 22 Redeem Israel, O God, <br>
 from all its distress.

## Psalm 25

Psalm 26(25) Iudica me, Domine[026]()

 1 Give judgment for me, O Lord, <br>
 for I have walked in my integrity; <br>
 in the Lord I have trusted <br>
 and have not faltered. <br>
 2 Test me, O Lord, and try me; <br>
 search my heart and my mind. <br>
 3 For your love is before my eyes, <br>
 and I walk in your truth. <br>
 4 I never take my seat with lying men, <br>
 nor consort with hypocrites; <br>
 5 I hate the company of evildoers, <br>
 nor do I sit down with the wicked. <br>
 6 I will wash my hands in innocence <br>
 and go round your altar, Lord, <br>
 7 proclaiming my thanks, <br>
 and telling of all your wonders. <br>
 8 I love the house where you dwell, <br>
 O Lord, the place where your glory abides. <br>
 9 Do not sweep me off with sinners, <br>
 or my life with men of blood, <br>
 10 in whose hands are wicked plots, <br>
 whose right hands are full of bribes. <br>
 11 As for me, I walk in integrity; <br>
 redeem me, and have mercy on me. <br>
 12 My foot stands on level ground: <br>
 I will bless the Lord in the assembly.

## Psalm 26

Psalm 27(26) Dominus illuminatio mea[027]()

 1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; <br>
 whom shall I fear? <br>
 The Lord is the stronghold of my life; <br>
 of whom shall I be afraid? <br>
 2 When evildoers draw near to devour my flesh, <br>
 it is they, my enemies and foes, <br>
 who stumble and fall. <br>
 3 Though an army encamp against me, <br>
 my heart would not fear. <br>
 Though war break out against me, <br>
 even then would I trust. <br>
 4 There is one thing I ask of the Lord, <br>
 for this I long, <br>
 to live in the house of the Lord <br>
 all the days of my life, <br>
 to savor the sweetness of the Lord, <br>
 to behold his temple. <br>
 5 For there he keeps me safe in time of trouble; <br>
 in a tent he hides me, <br>
 sets me high upon a rock. <br>
 6 Now my head is held high <br>
 above my enemies round about me; <br>
 and so in the tent I will offer <br>
 sacrifices of joy. <br>
 I will sing, I will chant praise to the Lord. <br>
 7 Hear, O Lord, my voice when I call; <br>
 have mercy and answer me. <br>
 8 Of you my heart has said, <br>
 “Seek his face.” <br>
 It is your face, O Lord, that I seek; <br>
 9 hide not your face from me. <br>
 Turn not your servant away in anger, <br>
 you who have been my help. <br>
 Do not cast me off, do not desert me, <br>
 O God, my savior! <br>
 10 Though my father and mother forsake me, <br>
 the Lord will receive me. <br>
 11 O Lord, teach me your way, <br>
 guide me on the path of integrity because of my foes. <br>
 12 Do not abandon me to the will of my foes, <br>
 false witnesses rise against me, <br>
 breathing out violence. <br>
 13 I believe I shall see the goodness of the Lord <br>
 in the land of the living. <br>
 14 Wait for the Lord, be strong; <br>
 have courage, and wait for the Lord.

## Psalm 27

Psalm 28(27) Ad te clamabo[028]()

 1 To you, O Lord, I call, <br>
 my rock, be not deaf to me. <br>
 If you do not answer me, <br>
 I shall go down to the pit like the rest. <br>
 2 Hear the voice of my pleading <br>
 as I call to you for help, <br>
 as I lift up my hands <br>
 to your holy sanctuary. <br>
 3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, <br>
 with the evildoers, <br>
 who speak words of peace to their neighbors, <br>
 but with malice in their hearts. <br>
 4 Repay them as their deeds deserve, <br>
 as their evil works merit, <br>
 repay them as their actions demand, <br>
 return to them their deserts. <br>
 5 For they care nothing for the Lord’s doings, <br>
 nor for the work of his hands; <br>
 may he pull them down <br>
 and not build them up. <br>
 6 Blessed be the Lord, <br>
 for he has heard the voice of my pleading. <br>
 7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; <br>
 in him my heart trusts, <br>
 and I find help. <br>
 So my heart exults, <br>
 and with my song I give him thanks. <br>
 8 The Lord is strength to his people, <br>
 a safe refuge for his anointed. <br>
 9 Save your people, and bless your heritage, <br>
 shepherd them, and carry them for ever.

## Psalm 28

Psalm 29(28) Afferte Domino[029]()

 1 O give the Lord, you sons of God, <br>
 give the Lord glory and power; <br>
 2 give the Lord the glory of his name. <br>
 Adore the Lord in his holy court. <br>
 3 The Lord’s voice resounding on the waters, <br>
 the Lord on the immensity of waters; <br>
 4 the voice of the Lord full of power, <br>
 the voice of the Lord full of splendor. <br>
 5 The Lord’s voice shattering the cedars, <br>
 the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon; <br>
 6 he makes Lebanon leap like a calf, <br>
 and Sirion like a young bull. <br>
 7 The Lord’s voice flashes flames of fire. <br>
 8 The Lord’s voice shaking the wilderness, <br>
 the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh; <br>
 9 the Lord’s voice rends the oak tree <br>
 and strips the forest bare. <br>
 In his temple they all cry, “Glory!” <br>
 10 The Lord sat enthroned over the flood; <br>
 the Lord sits as king for ever. <br>
 11 The Lord will give strength to his people; <br>
 the Lord will bless his people with peace.

## Psalm 29

Psalm 30(29) Exaltabo te[030]()

 2 I will extol you, Lord, for you have drawn me up; <br>
 you have not let my foes rejoice over me. <br>
 3 O Lord my God, I cried to you and you healed me. <br>
 4 Lord, you have raised my soul from the dead, <br>
 restored me to life from those who sink into the pit. <br>
 5 Sing psalms to the Lord, you his faithful, <br>
 and praise his holy name. <br>
 6 His anger lasts but a moment; <br>
 his favor a lifetime. <br>
 At night come tears, but dawn brings joy. <br>
 7 I said to myself in my good fortune: <br>
 “I shall never be shaken.” <br>
 8 Your favor, Lord, made me as a strong mountain. <br>
 You hid your face: I was dismayed. <br>
 9 To you, Lord, I cried, <br>
 to my God I made appeal: <br>
 10 “What profit is there in my death, <br>
 in my going down to the pit? <br>
 Can dust give you praise <br>
 or proclaim your truth?” <br>
 11 Lord, hear and have mercy on me; <br>
 Lord, be my helper. <br>
 12 You have turned my mourning into dancing, <br>
 you have stripped off my sackcloth <br>
 and girded me with joy. <br>
 13 So my soul sings psalms to you and will not be silent. <br>
 O Lord my God, I will praise you for ever.

## Psalm 30

Psalm 31(30) In te, Domine, speravi[031]()

 2 In you, O Lord, I take refuge. <br>
 Let me never be put to shame. <br>
 In your justice, set me free, <br>
 3 hear me and speedily rescue me. <br>
 Be a rock of refuge for me, <br>
 a mighty stronghold to save me, <br>
 4 for you are my rock, my stronghold. <br>
 For your name’s sake, lead me and guide me. <br>
 5 Release me from the snare which they have hidden, <br>
 for you indeed are my refuge. <br>
 6 Into your hands I commend my spirit. <br>
 You will redeem me, O Lord, O God of truth. <br>
 7 You detest those who serve vain gods. <br>
 As for me, I trust in the Lord: <br>
 8 be glad and rejoice in your mercy, <br>
 for you have seen my affliction, <br>
 9 and taken heed of my soul in its distress, <br>
 have not delivered me into the hands of the enemy, <br>
 but given me an open space to be at rest. <br>
 10 Have pity on me, Lord, for I am in distress. <br>
 Sorrow has worn away my eyes, <br>
 my throat, my heart. <br>
 11 For my years are spent in sighs, <br>
 my affliction has brought me low, <br>
 12 in my anguish I see only trouble. <br>
 My life is worn out with sorrow, <br>
 my years with sighing; <br>
 my strength grows weak under my guilt, <br>
 my bones waste away. <br>
 13 I am the scorn of all my foes, <br>
 a horror to my neighbors, <br>
 an object of dread to my friends. <br>
 14 Those who see me in the street run away; <br>
 I am forgotten, like a dead man out of mind. <br>
 I am like a shattered dish. <br>
 15 For I hear the whispering of the crowd; <br>
 fear is all around me, <br>
 as they scheme together against me, <br>
 as they plot to take my life. <br>
 16 But as for me, I trust in you, Lord, <br>
 I say: “You are my God. <br>
 17 My life is in your hands, deliver me <br>
 from the hands of my enemies <br>
 and from those who pursue me. <br>
 18 Let your face shine on your servant; <br>
 save me in your merciful love. <br>
 19 Lord, let me not be confounded, <br>
 for I have called to you.” <br>
 Let the wicked be confounded, <br>
 let them go down in silence to the dead. <br>
 20 Let their lying lips be silenced, <br>
 that speak insolently against the just <br>
 in pride and contempt. <br>
 21 How great is the goodness you have stored for those who fear you, <br>
 and wrought for men who trust you <br>
 in the sight of the sons of men! <br>
 22 You hide them in the shelter of your presence <br>
 from the plotting of men; <br>
 you keep them safe in a tent <br>
 from contentious tongues. <br>
 23 Blest be the Lord, <br>
 for he has marvelously shown me his steadfast love <br>
 in a fortified city. <br>
 24 I said in my alarm: <br>
 “I have been cut off from your sight.” <br>
 Yet you heard the voice of my prayer <br>
 when I cried to you for help. <br>
 25 Love the Lord, all you his chosen ones. <br>
 The Lord guards the faithful. <br>
 But the Lord will repay to the full <br>
 the one who acts with pride. <br>
 26 Be strong, let your heart take courage, <br>
 all who hope in the Lord.

## Psalm 31

Psalm 32(31) Beati quorum[032]()

 1 Happy the man whose offense is forgiven, <br>
 whose sin is blotted out. <br>
 2 Happy the man to whom the Lord imputes no guilt, <br>
 in whose spirit is no guile. <br>
 3 I kept it secret and my frame was wasted. <br>
 I groaned all day long, <br>
 4 for night and day your hand was heavy upon me. <br>
 Indeed, my strength was dried up <br>
 as by the summer’s heat. <br>
 5 But now I have acknowledged my sins; <br>
 my guilt I did not hide. <br>
 I said: “I will confess my offense to the Lord.” <br>
 And you, for your mercy, <br>
 have forgiven the guilt of my sin. <br>
 6 Thus every faithful one should pray to you <br>
 in time of distress. <br>
 Though torrents of water <br>
 threaten to overwhelm him, <br>
 he shall not be reached. <br>
 7 You are a hiding place for me; <br>
 you guard me from distress; <br>
 with cries of deliverance, you surround me. <br>
 8 I will instruct you and teach you <br>
 the way you should go; <br>
 I will keep my eyes on you. <br>
 9 Be not like horse and mule, unintelligent, <br>
 needing bridle and bit, <br>
 or they will not go near you. <br>
 10 Many sorrows has the wicked, <br>
 but he who trusts in the Lord <br>
 knows the mercy of God. <br>
 11 Rejoice, be glad in the Lord, <br>
 you upright; <br>
 shout for joy, you pure of heart.
