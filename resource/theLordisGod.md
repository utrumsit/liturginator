[Psalm 117]

The Lord is God and has revealed Himself to us; blessed  
is He Who comes in the Name of the Lord.  

*Verse 1:* Give thanks to the Lord for He is good; for His  
love endures forever.  

*Verse 2:* They encircled me, compassed me about; in the  
Lord’s Name I crushed them.  

*Verse 3:* I shall not die, I shall live and recount the deeds  
of the Lord.  

*Verse 4:* The stone which the builders rejected has become  
the cornerstone. This is the work of the Lord, a marvel in our  
eyes.
