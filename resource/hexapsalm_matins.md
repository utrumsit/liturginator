**Psalm 3**

How many are my foes, O Lord!
How many are rising up against me!
How many are saying about me:
There is no help for him in God.

But You, Lord, are a shield about me,
my glory, Who lift up my head.
I cry aloud to the Lord.
He answers from His holy mountain.

I lie down to rest and I sleep.
I wake, for the Lord upholds me.
I will not fear even thousands of people
who are ranged on every side against me.

Arise, Lord; save me, my God,
You Who strike all my foes on the mouth,
You Who break the teeth of the wicked!
O Lord of salvation, bless Your people!
I lie down to rest and I sleep.
I wake for the Lord upholds me.

O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger;
do not punish me, Lord, in Your rage.
Your arrows have sunk deep in me;
Your hand has come down upon me.
Through Your anger all my body is sick;
through my sin, there is no health in my limbs.

My guilt towers higher than my head;
it is a weight too heavy to bear.
My wounds are foul and festering,
the result of my own folly.
I am bowed and brought to my knees.
I go mourning all the day long.

All my frame burns with fever;
all my body is sick.
Spent and utterly crushed,
I cry aloud in anguish of heart.
O Lord, You know all my longing;
my groans are not hidden from You.
My heart throbs, my strength is spent;
the very light has gone from my eyes.

My friends avoid me like a leper;
those closest to me stand afar off.
Those who plot against my life lay snares;
those who seek my ruin speak of harm,
planning treachery all the day long.

But I am like the deaf who cannot hear,
like the dumb unable to speak.

I am like a man who hears nothing
in whose mouth is no defense.

I count on You, O Lord;
it is You, Lord God, Who will answer.
I pray: ‘Do not let them mock me,
those who triumph if my foot should slip.’

For I am on the point of falling
and my pain is always before me.
I confess that I am guilty
and my sin fills me with dismay.

My wanton enemies are numberless
and my lying foes are many.
They repay me evil for good
and attack me for seeking what is right.
O Lord, do not forsake me!
My God, do not stay afar off!
Make haste and come to my help,

O Lord, my God, my Savior!

O Lord, do not forsake me!
My God, do not stay afar off!
Make haste and come to my help,
O Lord, my God, my Savior!

**Psalm 62**

O God, You are my God, for You I long;
for You my soul is thirsting.
My body pines for You

So I gaze on You in the sanctuary
to see Your strength and Your glory.

For Your love is better than life;
my lips will speak Your praise.
So I will bless You all my life;
in Your name I will lift up my hands.
My soul shall be filled as with a banquet;
my mouth shall praise You with joy.

On my bed I remember You.
On You I muse through the night
for You have been my help;
in the shadow of Your wings I rejoice.
My soul clings to You;
Your right hand holds me fast.

Those who seek to destroy my life
shall go down to the depths of the earth.
They shall be put into the power of the sword
and left as the prey of the jackals.

But the king shall rejoice in God;
(all that swear by Him shall be blessed)
for the mouth of liars shall be silenced.

On You I muse through the night
for You have been my help;
in the shadow of Your wings I rejoice.
My soul clings to You;
Your right hand holds me fast.

Glory: now and ever:

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Glory to You, O God! Three

times, without bows.

Lord, have mercy. Three times.

Glory: now and ever:

But the priest says quietly the prayers of Matins, standing,

with head uncovered, before the holy doors.

**Psalm 87**

Lord my God, I call for help by day;
I cry at night before You.
Let my prayer come into Your presence.
O turn Your ear to my cry

For my soul is filled with evils;
my life is on the brink of the grave.
I am reckoned as one in the tomb;
I have reached the end of my strength,

like one alone among the dead,
like the slain lying in their graves,
like those You remember no more,
cut off, as they are, from Your hand.

You have laid me in the depths of the tomb,
in places that are dark, in the depths.
Your anger weighs down upon me:
I am drowned beneath Your waves.

and made me hateful in their sight.
Imprisoned, I cannot escape;
my eyes are sunken with grief.

I call to You, Lord, all the day long;
to You I stretch out my hands.
Will You work wonders for the dead?
Will the shades stand and praise You?

Will Your love be told in the grave
or Your faithfulness among the dead?
Will Your wonders be known in the dark
or Your justice in the land of oblivion?

As for me, Lord, I call to You for help:
in the morning my prayer comes before You.
Lord, why do You reject me?
Why do You hide Your face?

Wretched, close to death from my youth,
I have borne Your trials, I am numb.
Your fury has swept down upon me;
Your terrors have utterly destroyed me.

They surround me all the day like a flood,
they assail me all together.
Friend and neighbor You have taken away:
my one companion is darkness.

Lord my God, I call for help by day;
I cry at night before You.
Let my prayer come into Your presence.
O turn Your ear to my cry.

**Psalm 102**

Bless the Lord, O my soul,
and all my being bless His holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul,
and forget not all His blessings.

It is He Who forgives all your guilt
Who heals every one of your ills,
Who redeems your life from the grave,
Who crowns you with love and compassion,
Who fills your life with good things
renewing your youth like an eagle’s.

The Lord secures justice
and the rights of all the oppressed.
He made known His ways to Moses,
and His deeds to Israel’s sons.

The Lord is compassion and love,
slow to anger and rich in mercy.
His wrath will come to an end;
He will not be angry for ever.
He does not treat us according to our sins
nor repay us according to our faults.
For as the heavens are high above the earth,
so strong is His love for those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west,
so far does He remove our sins.

As a father has compassion on his sons,
the Lord has pity on those who fear Him.
For He knows of what we are made,

As for man, his days are like grass;
he flowers like the flower of the field;
the wind blows and he is gone
and his place never sees him again.

But the kindness of the Lord is everlasting
upon those who hold Him in fear;
His justice reaches out to children’s children
when they keep His covenant in truth,
when they remember His commands and do them.

The Lord has set His throne in heaven,
and His kingdom is ruling over all.
Bless the Lord, all His angels,
mighty in power, fulfilling His word,
who heed the voice of His word.
Bless the Lord, all His hosts,
His servants, who do His will.
Bless the Lord, all His works,
in every place where He rules.
Bless the Lord, O my soul.

Bless the Lord, all His works,
in every place where He rules.
Bless the Lord, O my soul!

**Psalm 142**

Lord, listen to my prayer:
turn Your ear to my appeal.
You are faithful, You are just; give answer.

Do not call Your servant to judgment.
For no one is just in Your sight.

The enemy pursues my soul;
he has crushed my life to the ground;
he has made me dwell in darkness
like the dead, long forgotten.
Therefore, my spirit fails;
my heart is numb within me.

I remember the days that are past;
I ponder all Your works.

I muse on what Your hand has wrought
and to You I stretch out my hands.
Like a parched land my soul thirsts for You.

Lord, make haste and answer;
for my spirit fails within me.
Do not hide Your face
lest I become like those in the grave.

In the morning let me know Your love
for I put my trust in You.
Make me know the way I should walk;
to You I lift up my soul.

Rescue me, Lord, from my enemies;
I have fled to You for refuge.
Teach me to do Your will
for You, O Lord, are my God.
Let Your good spirit guide me
in ways that are level and smooth.

in Your justice save my soul from distress.
In Your love make an end of my foes;
destroy all those who oppress me
for I am Your servant, O Lord.
Lord, listen to my prayer:
in Your justice, do not call Your servant to judgment.
Lord, listen to my prayer:
in Your justice, do not call Your servant to judgment.

Let Your good spirit guide me
in ways that are level and smooth.

Glory: now and ever:

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Glory to You, O God! Three

times.
