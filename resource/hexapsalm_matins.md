Psalm 3

How many are my foes, O Lord!
How many are rising up against me!
How many are saying about me:
There is no help for him in God.

But You, Lord, are a shield about me,
my glory, Who lift up my head.
I cry aloud to the Lord.
He answers from His holy mountain.

I lie down to rest and I sleep.
I wake, for the Lord upholds me.
I will not fear even thousands of people
who are ranged on every side against me.

Arise, Lord; save me, my God,
You Who strike all my foes on the mouth,
You Who break the teeth of the wicked!
O Lord of salvation, bless Your people!
I lie down to rest and I sleep.
I wake for the Lord upholds me.

O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger;
do not punish me, Lord, in Your rage.
Your arrows have sunk deep in me;
Your hand has come down upon me.
Through Your anger all my body is sick;
through my sin, there is no health in my limbs.

My guilt towers higher than my head;
it is a weight too heavy to bear.
My wounds are foul and festering,
the result of my own folly.
I am bowed and brought to my knees.
I go mourning all the day long.

All my frame burns with fever;
all my body is sick.
Spent and utterly crushed,
I cry aloud in anguish of heart.
O Lord, You know all my longing;
my groans are not hidden from You.
My heart throbs, my strength is spent;
the very light has gone from my eyes.

My friends avoid me like a leper;
those closest to me stand afar off.
Those who plot against my life lay snares;
those who seek my ruin speak of harm,
planning treachery all the day long.

But I am like the deaf who cannot hear,
like the dumb unable to speak.

I am like a man who hears nothing
in whose mouth is no defense.

I count on You, O Lord;
it is You, Lord God, Who will answer.
I pray: ‘Do not let them mock me,
those who triumph if my foot should slip.’

For I am on the point of falling
and my pain is always before me.
I confess that I am guilty
and my sin fills me with dismay.

My wanton enemies are numberless
and my lying foes are many.
They repay me evil for good
and attack me for seeking what is right.
O Lord, do not forsake me!
My God, do not stay afar off!
Make haste and come to my help,

O Lord, my God, my Savior!

O Lord, do not forsake me!
My God, do not stay afar off!
Make haste and come to my help,
O Lord, my God, my Savior!

Psalm 62

O God, You are my God, for You I long;
for You my soul is thirsting.
My body pines for You

So I gaze on You in the sanctuary
to see Your strength and Your glory.

For Your love is better than life;
my lips will speak Your praise.
So I will bless You all my life;
in Your name I will lift up my hands.
My soul shall be filled as with a banquet;
my mouth shall praise You with joy.

On my bed I remember You.
On You I muse through the night
for You have been my help;
in the shadow of Your wings I rejoice.
My soul clings to You;
Your right hand holds me fast.

Those who seek to destroy my life
shall go down to the depths of the earth.
They shall be put into the power of the sword
and left as the prey of the jackals.

But the king shall rejoice in God;
(all that swear by Him shall be blessed)
for the mouth of liars shall be silenced.

On You I muse through the night
for You have been my help;
in the shadow of Your wings I rejoice.
My soul clings to You;
Your right hand holds me fast.

Glory: now and ever:

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Glory to You, O God! Three

times, without bows.

Lord, have mercy. Three times.

Glory: now and ever:

But the priest says quietly the prayers of Matins, standing,

with head uncovered, before the holy doors.

Psalm 87

Lord my God, I call for help by day;
I cry at night before You.
Let my prayer come into Your presence.
O turn Your ear to my cry

For my soul is filled with evils;
my life is on the brink of the grave.
I am reckoned as one in the tomb;
I have reached the end of my strength,

like one alone among the dead,
like the slain lying in their graves,
like those You remember no more,
cut off, as they are, from Your hand.

You have laid me in the depths of the tomb,
in places that are dark, in the depths.
Your anger weighs down upon me:
I am drowned beneath Your waves.

and made me hateful in their sight.
Imprisoned, I cannot escape;
my eyes are sunken with grief.

I call to You, Lord, all the day long;
to You I stretch out my hands.
Will You work wonders for the dead?
Will the shades stand and praise You?

Will Your love be told in the grave
or Your faithfulness among the dead?
Will Your wonders be known in the dark
or Your justice in the land of oblivion?

As for me, Lord, I call to You for help:
in the morning my prayer comes before You.
Lord, why do You reject me?
Why do You hide Your face?

Wretched, close to death from my youth,
I have borne Your trials, I am numb.
Your fury has swept down upon me;
Your terrors have utterly destroyed me.

They surround me all the day like a flood,
they assail me all together.
Friend and neighbor You have taken away:
my one companion is darkness.

Lord my God, I call for help by day;
I cry at night before You.
Let my prayer come into Your presence.
O turn Your ear to my cry.

Psalm 102

Bless the Lord, O my soul,
and all my being bless His holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul,
and forget not all His blessings.

It is He Who forgives all your guilt
Who heals every one of your ills,
Who redeems your life from the grave,
Who crowns you with love and compassion,
Who fills your life with good things
renewing your youth like an eagle’s.

The Lord secures justice
and the rights of all the oppressed.
He made known His ways to Moses,
and His deeds to Israel’s sons.

The Lord is compassion and love,
slow to anger and rich in mercy.
His wrath will come to an end;
He will not be angry for ever.
He does not treat us according to our sins
nor repay us according to our faults.
For as the heavens are high above the earth,
so strong is His love for those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west,
so far does He remove our sins.

As a father has compassion on his sons,
the Lord has pity on those who fear Him.
For He knows of what we are made,

As for man, his days are like grass;
he flowers like the flower of the field;
the wind blows and he is gone
and his place never sees him again.

But the kindness of the Lord is everlasting
upon those who hold Him in fear;
His justice reaches out to children’s children
when they keep His covenant in truth,
when they remember His commands and do them.

The Lord has set His throne in heaven,
and His kingdom is ruling over all.
Bless the Lord, all His angels,
mighty in power, fulfilling His word,
who heed the voice of His word.
Bless the Lord, all His hosts,
His servants, who do His will.
Bless the Lord, all His works,
in every place where He rules.
Bless the Lord, O my soul.

Bless the Lord, all His works,
in every place where He rules.
Bless the Lord, O my soul!

Psalm 142

Lord, listen to my prayer:
turn Your ear to my appeal.
You are faithful, You are just; give answer.

Do not call Your servant to judgment.
For no one is just in Your sight.

The enemy pursues my soul;
he has crushed my life to the ground;
he has made me dwell in darkness
like the dead, long forgotten.
Therefore, my spirit fails;
my heart is numb within me.

I remember the days that are past;
I ponder all Your works.

I muse on what Your hand has wrought
and to You I stretch out my hands.
Like a parched land my soul thirsts for You.

Lord, make haste and answer;
for my spirit fails within me.
Do not hide Your face
lest I become like those in the grave.

In the morning let me know Your love
for I put my trust in You.
Make me know the way I should walk;
to You I lift up my soul.

Rescue me, Lord, from my enemies;
I have fled to You for refuge.
Teach me to do Your will
for You, O Lord, are my God.
Let Your good spirit guide me
in ways that are level and smooth.

in Your justice save my soul from distress.
In Your love make an end of my foes;
destroy all those who oppress me
for I am Your servant, O Lord.
Lord, listen to my prayer:
in Your justice, do not call Your servant to judgment.
Lord, listen to my prayer:
in Your justice, do not call Your servant to judgment.

Let Your good spirit guide me
in ways that are level and smooth.

Glory: now and ever:

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia. Glory to You, O God! Three

times.

While the Six Psalms are being read, the priest says these
prayers:

The First Prayer

We thank You, Lord our God, for You have raised us up
from our beds, and have filled our mouths with a word of
praise that we might worship You and call upon Your holy
Name, and we beseech You by Your compassion with which
You have always treated our life: also now send help to those
who stand before the countenance of Your holy glory and
await Your rich mercy; and grant, that with fear and love, they
may always offer worship, to praise Your ineffable goodness.
For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory,

honor, and worship, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Second Prayer

From the night our spirit rises early unto You, our God,
for Your commandments are a light upon the earth. Give us
understanding that we may be perfected in righteousness and
holiness in fear of You, for it is You Whom we glorify as our
true God. Incline Your ear and hear us, O Lord, and remember
all present and praying with us by name, and save them by
Your might. Bless Your people and sanctify Your inheritance.
Give peace to Your world, to Your churches, to the priests,
to the government (or to our God-protected king), and to all
Your people.

For blessed and glorified is Your all-honored and sublime
Name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever.
Amen.

The Third Prayer

From the night our spirit rises early to You, O God,
for Your commandments are light. Teach us, O God, Your
righteousness, Your commandments, and Your statutes.
Enlighten the eyes of our understanding so that we never fall
asleep in sins unto death. Drive out all gloomy darkness from
our hearts. Give us the Sun of Justice, and by the seal of Your
Holy Spirit preserve our life unassailed. Direct our steps in the
way of peace. Grant us to see the dawn and the day in joy that
we may send up our morning prayers to You.

For Yours is the might, and Yours are the kingdom, and
the power, and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now
and ever and forever. Amen.

O Master God, holy and beyond understanding, Who
commanded light to shine out of darkness, Who have given
us rest in the sleep of night and have raised us up for the
glorification and supplication of Your goodness, we entreat
You of Your own tender compassion; also accept us who
now worship You and give thanks to You as much as it is in
our power, and grant us all our petitions which are for our
salvation. Show us to be sons of light and of the day and
heirs of Your eternal good gifts. Remember, O Lord, in the
multitude of Your mercies all Your people, both those who
are praying with us as well as all our brethren on land, at
sea, [in the air,] and in every place of Your dominion who are
in need of Your love for mankind and help; and grant Your
great mercy to all so that, being preserved in safety in soul and
body, with confidence we may give glory to Your wondrous
and blessed Name.

For You are a merciful, gracious God and You love
mankind, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Fifth Prayer

Treasury of Blessings, Ever-flowing Fountain, Holy
Father, Wonderworker, All-powerful and Almighty One, we
all worship You and pray to You, imploring Your mercies and
compassions to help and protect our lowliness. Remember,
O Lord, Your servants. Receive the morning prayers of us all
like incense before You, and let none of us be found unfit,
but encompass us all with Your mercies. Remember, O Lord,
those who keep vigil and sing of Your glory, and of Your only-
begotten Son and our God, and of Your Holy Spirit. Be their
Helper and Defender. Accept their supplications upon Your

heavenly and spiritual altar.

For You are our God, and to You we give glory, to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever
and forever. Amen.

The Sixth Prayer

We give thanks to You, Lord God of our salvation, for You
do all things for the well-being of our life that we may always
look to You, the Savior and Benefactor of our souls; for You
have given us rest in that time of the night that has passed
and have raised us up from our beds and appointed us in the
worship of Your honorable Name. Therefore, we pray You, O
Lord, give us grace and power that we may be made worthy
to sing to You with understanding and to pray unceasingly in
fear and trembling, working out our salvation with the help
of Your Christ. Remember also, O Lord, those who cry out to
You in the night. Hear them and have mercy, and crush under
their feet invisible and hostile enemies.

For You are the King of peace, and the Savior of our souls,
and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now
and ever and forever. Amen.

The Seventh Prayer

God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who have
raised us from our beds and gathered us at this hour of prayer,
give us grace in the opening of our mouths and receive our
thanksgivings according to the ability of our power, and teach
us Your statutes. For we do not know how to pray as we
ought, unless You, O Lord, instruct us by Your Holy Spirit.
Therefore, we pray to You: remit, pardon, forgive if we have
sinned in any way unto this very hour by word or deed or
thought, voluntarily or involuntarily; for if You, O Lord,

You is found redemption. You alone are holy, the powerful
Helper, Defender of our life, and our songs are always of You.
May the might of Your kingdom be blessed and glorified,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Eighth Prayer

Lord our God, Who have banished from us the slothfulness
of sleep, and have summoned us together by a holy calling
to lift up our hands also in the night and confess to You
the righteousness of Your judgments: Receive our prayers,
petitions, confessions, and nocturnal worship; and grant us, O
God, a faith unashamed, confident hope, and a love without
pretense. Bless our comings and goings, our deeds, works,
words, thoughts; and grant us to come to the beginning of
the day, praising, singing, and blessing the greatness of Your
ineffable power.

For blessed is Your all-holy Name, and glorified is Your
kingdom, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and
forever. Amen.

The Ninth Prayer

Lord our God, Who have given mankind remission of
sins through repentance, and have shown us the repentance
of the prophet David that led to pardon as a model of
acknowledgement and confession of sins: You, Yourself, O
Master, according to Your great mercy have mercy on us who
have fallen into so many and so great offenses, and in Your
compassion blot out our offenses. For against You have we
sinned, O Lord, Who know both the hidden and secret things
of the human heart, and Who alone have power to forgive
sins. A pure heart You have created in us and have established

us with Your guiding Spirit, and have shown us the joy of
Your salvation; do not cast us from Your face. But, as You are
good and love mankind, be well-pleased that we may offer
to You a sacrifice of righteousness and oblation on Your holy
altars even until our last breath.

Through the mercy and compassion and loving-kindness
of Your only-begotten Son with Whom You are blessed,
together with Your all-holy and good and life-creating Spirit,
now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Tenth Prayer

O God, our God, Who by Your will have brought into
being the spiritual and rational Powers, we pray You and
we implore You: Receive our hymns of glorification which
together with all Your creatures we offer according to our
strength, and grant us in return the rich gifts of Your loving-
kindness. For to You bows every knee in heaven and on earth
and in the infernal regions, and everything that has breath and
all creation sings Your incomprehensible glory. For You alone
are the true and most-merciful God.

For all the heavenly Powers praise You, and we give glory
to You, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Eleventh Prayer

We praise You, we sing to You, we bless You, and we
give thanks to You, God of our fathers, for You have brought
us through the shades of night and have shown us again the
light of day. But we pray Your loving goodness: cleanse our
sins, and accept our prayer in Your great tender goodness,
for we flee to Your refuge, O merciful and all-powerful God.
Make the true Sun of Justice shine in our hearts, enlighten

the way of Your commandments as in the day, we may attain
to life eternal, for with You is the fountain of life, and may
we be deemed worthy to come to the enjoyment of Your
unapproachable light.

For You are our God, and to You we give glory, to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever
and forever. Amen.

Then, the Great Ektenia:

In peace, let us pray to the Lord.

After each of the following petitions, the choir sings:

Lord, have mercy.

For our government (or for our God-protected Emperor
or King Name) and for all in the service of our country, let us
pray to the Lord.

For this city (or for this village, or for this holy monastery),

the earth, and for peaceful times, let us pray to the Lord.

For our most reverend Archbishop and Metropolitan
(Name), for our God-loving Bishop (Name), for the venerable
presbyterate, the diaconate in Christ, and all the clergy and the
people, let us pray to the Lord.

Protect us, save us, have mercy on us and preserve us, O

God, by Your grace.

Commemorating our most holy, most pure, most blessed
and glorious Lady, the Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary, with
all the saints, let us commit ourselves and one another and our
whole life to Christ our God.
Choir: To You, O Lord.

Exclamation:

For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory,

honor, and worship, now and ever and forever.

Choir: Amen.

And immediately the following is sung in the tone of the

troparion of the day:

[Psalm 117]

The Lord is God and has revealed Himself to us; blessed

is He Who comes in the Name of the Lord.

Verse 1: Give thanks to the Lord for He is good; for His

love endures forever.

Verse 2: They encircled me, compassed me about; in the

Lord’s Name I crushed them.

Verse 3: I shall not die, I shall live and recount the deeds

of the Lord.

Verse 4: The stone which the builders rejected has become
the cornerstone. This is the work of the Lord, a marvel in our
eyes.

Then we say the appointed troparion twice and the
theotokion in the same tone. If two troparia are appointed, the
first is always said twice, then the second and the theotokion
are said.
_________________________________________________

If, however, it is [a period when] Alleluia [is sung,] or
the Great Forty Day Fast, instead of The Lord is God we sing
Alleluia three times according to the tone of the octoechos.

[Isaiah 26]

Verse 1: My spirit yearns for You in the night; yes, my

spirit within me keeps vigil for You.

Verse 2: When Your judgment dawns upon the earth, the

world’s inhabitants learn justice.

Verse 3: Let them be shamed when they see Your zeal for
Your people; let the fire prepared for Your enemies consume
them.

Verse 4: You have increased the nation, O Lord, increased

the nation to Your own glory.

And after Alleluia, the Trinitarian Hymns of the tone,

each one said once.

Then the stichologia of the Psalter.

At weekday Matins the ektenias after the kathismata are
not said except on Saturday, saints with the Great Doxology,

But after the completion of the first stichologion, the

deacon or the priest does the petitions of the Little Ektenia:

God, by Your grace.

Choir: Lord, have mercy.

Commemorating our most holy, most pure, most blessed

crucifixion, has destroyed Death by His death.

[Morning Praise]

After this, Psalm 50:

Have mercy on me, God, in Your kindness.
In Your compassion blot out my offence.
O wash me more and more from my guilt
and cleanse me from my sin.

My offences truly I know them;
my sin is always before me.
Against You, You alone, have I sinned;
what is evil in Your sight I have done.

That You may be justified when You give sentence
and be without reproach when You judge
O see, in guilt I was born,
a sinner was I conceived.

Indeed You love truth in the heart;
then in the secret of my heart teach me wisdom
O sprinkle me with hyssop then I shall be clean;
O wash me, I shall be whiter than snow.

Make me hear rejoicing and gladness,
that the bones You have crushed may thrill.
From my sins turn away Your face
and blot out all my guilt.

A pure heart create for me, O God,
put a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me away from Your presence,
nor deprive me of Your Holy Spirit.

Give me again the joy of Your help;
with a spirit of fervour sustain me,
That I may teach transgressors Your ways
and sinners may return to You.

O rescue me, God, my helper,
and my tongue shall ring out Your goodness.
O Lord, open my lips
and my mouth shall declare Your praise.

For in sacrifice You take no delight,
burnt offering from me You would refuse,
My sacrifice, a contrite spirit.
A humbled, contrite heart, You will not spurn.

In Your goodness, O Lord, show favor to Zion:
Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Then You will be pleased with lawful sacrifice,

(burnt offerings wholly consumed),
then You will be offered young bulls on Your altar.

Then, if it is the holy and great Forty Day Fast, except
Saturdays and Thursday of the Great Canon, the deacon, or
the priest, says this prayer:

Save Your people, O God, and bless Your inheritance.
Visit Your world with Your mercy and generosities. Exalt the
Christian people of the true faith and send down upon us Your
abundant mercy. Through the prayers of our all-pure Lady, the
Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary; through the power of the
precious and life-creating cross; through the protection of the
honorable, heavenly, incorporeal powers; of the honorable,
glorious, Prophet, Forerunner, and Baptist, John; of the holy,
glorious, and praiseworthy apostles; (or of the holy apostle
and evangelist Name, and of all the holy, glorious, and
praiseworthy apostles;) and of our fathers among the saints,
the great ecumenical teachers and hierarchs: Basil the Great,
Gregory the Theologian, and John Chrysostom; of our father
among the saints, Nicholas the Wonderworker, archbishop of
Myra in Lycia; of the holy Cyril and Methodius, equals-to-
the-apostles, teachers of the Slavs; of the holy well-believing
great prince Vladimir, equal-to-the-apostles; of our holy
priest-martyr Josaphat; of the holy, glorious, and victorious
martyrs; of our venerable and God-bearing fathers Anthony
and Theodosius of the Monastery of the Caves; and of all our
venerable and God-bearing fathers; of the holy and righteous
ancestors of God, Joachim and Anna; of Saint Name (whose
church it is), Saint (Name), whose memory we celebrate; and
of all the saints; we pray You, O most merciful Lord, hear us
sinners praying to You, and have mercy on us.

Choir: Lord, have mercy. 12.

The priest exclaims:

Through the mercy and compassion and loving-kindness
of Your only-begotten Son, with Whom You are blessed,
together with Your most-holy and good and life-creating
Spirit, now and ever and forever.

Choir: Amen.

And we begin the scriptural canticles and the canons.

After the Third Ode, the priest says the Little Ektenia:

Again and again: Protect us, save us: Commemorating

our most holy, most pure:

Exclamation:

For Yours is the might, and Yours are the kingdom and the
power, and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and
ever and forever.

Choir: Amen. Then, the Sessional Hymn.

After the Sixth Ode, the ektenia:

Again and again: Protect us, save us: Commemorating

our most holy, most pure:

Exclamation:

For You are the King of peace and the Savior of our souls,
and to You we give glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now
and ever and forever.

The kontakion and the ikos and the reading from the

synaxarion.

After the completion of the katavasia of the Eighth Ode,

the deacon or the priest exclaims:

Let us greatly extol the Theotokos and the Mother of

Light in hymns!

The Canticle of the Theotokos
from the Holy Gospel according to Luke

The ancient verse: We extol the Theotokos in hymns!

My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in

God, my Savior.

And after each of the following sing the verse: More
honorable than the cherubim, and beyond compare more
glorious than the seraphim; who, a virgin, gave birth to God
the Word, you, truly the Theotokos, we magnify.

Because He has regarded the humility of His handmaid,
for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me
blessed, sing the verse.

Because He Who is mighty has done great things for me,
and holy is His Name, and His love is from generation to
generation to those who fear Him, sing the verse.

He has shown might with His arm; He has scattered the

proud in the conceit of their heart, sing the verse.

He has put down the mighty from their seat and has
exalted the humble; He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich He has sent away empty, sing the verse.

He has received Israel, His servant, being mindful of His
love, as He spoke to our Fathers, to Abraham and to his seed
forever, sing the verse.

After the Ninth Ode:

It is truly proper to glorify you, O Theotokos, the ever-
blessed, immaculate, and the mother of our God. More
honorable than the cherubim, and beyond compare more
glorious than the seraphim; who, a virgin, gave birth to God
the Word, you, truly the Theotokos, we magnify.

But if it is a prefestive or a postfestive It is truly proper: is

not sung, but immediately the ektenia.

After the Ninth Ode, the ektenia:

Again and again: Protect us, save us: Commemorating

our most holy, most pure:

Exclamation:

For all the heavenly Powers praise You, and we give glory
to You, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
now and ever and forever.

Choir: Amen.
