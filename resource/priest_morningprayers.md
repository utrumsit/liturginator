[Priest Morning Prayers]

**Logic Note:** The priest says these prayers while the Six Psalms are being read.

The First Prayer

We thank You, Lord our God, for You have raised us up from our beds, and have filled our mouths with a word of praise that we might worship You and call upon Your holy Name, and we beseech You by Your compassion with which You have always treated our life: also now send help to those who stand before the countenance of Your holy glory and await Your rich mercy; and grant, that with fear and love, they may always offer worship, to praise Your ineffable goodness. For to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is due all glory, honor, and worship, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Second Prayer

From the night our spirit rises early unto You, our God, for Your commandments are a light upon the earth. Give us understanding that we may be perfected in righteousness and holiness in fear of You, for it is You Whom we glorify as our true God. Incline Your ear and hear us, O Lord, and remember all present and praying with us by name, and save them by Your might. Bless Your people and sanctify Your inheritance. Give peace to Your world, to Your churches, to the priests, to the government (or to our God-protected king), and to all Your people.

For blessed and glorified is Your all-honored and sublime Name, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Third Prayer

From the night our spirit rises early to You, O God, for Your commandments are light. Teach us, O God, Your righteousness, Your commandments, and Your statutes. Enlighten the eyes of our understanding so that we never fall asleep in sins unto death. Drive out all gloomy darkness from our hearts. Give us the Sun of Justice, and by the seal of Your Holy Spirit preserve our life unassailed. Direct our steps in the way of peace. Grant us to see the dawn and the day in joy that we may send up our morning prayers to You.

For Yours is the might, and Yours are the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Fourth Prayer

O Master God, holy and beyond understanding, Who commanded light to shine out of darkness, Who have given us rest in the sleep of night and have raised us up for the glorification and supplication of Your goodness, we entreat You of Your own tender compassion; also accept us who now worship You and give thanks to You as much as it is in our power, and grant us all our petitions which are for our salvation. Show us to be sons of light and of the day and heirs of Your eternal good gifts. Remember, O Lord, in the multitude of Your mercies all Your people, both those who are praying with us as well as all our brethren on land, at sea, [in the air,] and in every place of Your dominion who are in need of Your love for mankind and help; and grant Your great mercy to all so that, being preserved in safety in soul and body, with confidence we may give glory to Your wondrous and blessed Name.

For You are a merciful, gracious God and You love mankind, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Fifth Prayer

Treasury of Blessings, Ever-flowing Fountain, Holy Father, Wonderworker, All-powerful and Almighty One, we all worship You and pray to You, imploring Your mercies and compassions to help and protect our lowliness. Remember, O Lord, Your servants. Receive the morning prayers of us all like incense before You, and let none of us be found unfit, but encompass us all with Your mercies. Remember, O Lord, those who keep vigil and sing of Your glory, and of Your only-begotten Son and our God, and of Your Holy Spirit. Be their Helper and Defender. Accept their supplications upon Your heavenly and spiritual altar.

For You are our God, and to You we give glory, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Sixth Prayer

We give thanks to You, Lord God of our salvation, for You do all things for the well-being of our life that we may always look to You, the Savior and Benefactor of our souls; for You have given us rest in that time of the night that has passed and have raised us up from our beds and appointed us in the worship of Your honorable Name. Therefore, we pray You, O Lord, give us grace and power that we may be made worthy to sing to You with understanding and to pray unceasingly in fear and trembling, working out our salvation with the help of Your Christ. Remember also, O Lord, those who cry out to You in the night. Hear them and have mercy, and crush under their feet invisible and hostile enemies.

For You are the King of peace, and the Savior of our souls, and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Seventh Prayer

God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who have raised us from our beds and gathered us at this hour of prayer, give us grace in the opening of our mouths and receive our thanksgivings according to the ability of our power, and teach us Your statutes. For we do not know how to pray as we ought, unless You, O Lord, instruct us by Your Holy Spirit. Therefore, we pray to You: remit, pardon, forgive if we have sinned in any way unto this very hour by word or deed or thought, voluntarily or involuntarily; for if You, O Lord, should mark our guilt, Lord, who would survive? But with You is found redemption. You alone are holy, the powerful Helper, Defender of our life, and our songs are always of You. May the might of Your kingdom be blessed and glorified, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Eighth Prayer

Lord our God, Who have banished from us the slothfulness of sleep, and have summoned us together by a holy calling to lift up our hands also in the night and confess to You the righteousness of Your judgments: Receive our prayers, petitions, confessions, and nocturnal worship; and grant us, O God, a faith unashamed, confident hope, and a love without pretense. Bless our comings and goings, our deeds, works, words, thoughts; and grant us to come to the beginning of the day, praising, singing, and blessing the greatness of Your ineffable power.

For blessed is Your all-holy Name, and glorified is Your kingdom, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Ninth Prayer

Lord our God, Who have given mankind remission of sins through repentance, and have shown us the repentance of the prophet David that led to pardon as a model of acknowledgement and confession of sins: You, Yourself, O Master, according to Your great mercy have mercy on us who have fallen into so many and so great offenses, and in Your compassion blot out our offenses. For against You have we sinned, O Lord, Who know both the hidden and secret things of the human heart, and Who alone have power to forgive sins. A pure heart You have created in us and have established us with Your guiding Spirit, and have shown us the joy of Your salvation; do not cast us from Your face. But, as You are good and love mankind, be well-pleased that we may offer to You a sacrifice of righteousness and oblation on Your holy altars even until our last breath.

Through the mercy and compassion and loving-kindness of Your only-begotten Son with Whom You are blessed, together with Your all-holy and good and life-creating Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Tenth Prayer

O God, our God, Who by Your will have brought into being the spiritual and rational Powers, we pray You and we implore You: Receive our hymns of glorification which together with all Your creatures we offer according to our strength, and grant us in return the rich gifts of Your loving-kindness. For to You bows every knee in heaven and on earth and in the infernal regions, and everything that has breath and all creation sings Your incomprehensible glory. For You alone are the true and most-merciful God.

For all the heavenly Powers praise You, and we give glory to You, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.

The Eleventh Prayer

We praise You, we sing to You, we bless You, and we give thanks to You, God of our fathers, for You have brought us through the shades of night and have shown us again the light of day. But we pray Your loving goodness: cleanse our sins, and accept our prayer in Your great tender goodness, for we flee to Your refuge, O merciful and all-powerful God. Make the true Sun of Justice shine in our hearts, enlighten our mind, and guard all our senses, so that walking nobly in the way of Your commandments as in the day, we may attain to life eternal, for with You is the fountain of life, and may we be deemed worthy to come to the enjoyment of Your unapproachable light.

For You are our God, and to You we give glory, to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever. Amen.
