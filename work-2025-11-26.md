Completed the population of the liturgical lectionary through the 29th Sunday after Pentecost. The scripture_readings.json now contains readings for the entire Pascha season and Pentecostarion up to week 29.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Pascha Season (Days 0-49)

- **Weeks 2-7 (Days 7-48)**: Added Second through Seventh Weeks with daily readings, Matins Gospels, and Vespers Paramia for applicable days.
- **Pentecost (Day 49)**: Included Ascension and Pentecost readings.

### 2. Pentecostarion (Weeks 1-29 after Pentecost)
- **Weekdays**: Populated for Weeks 1-3 with Monday-Saturday readings.
- **Sundays**: Added for all 29 weeks, including epistle, gospel, Matins Gospel, and Vespers Paramia (for Week 1).
- **Automation**: Developed scripts to extract and populate readings from mci-lectionary.md.

### 3. Enhancements
- **Titles**: Added descriptive titles for all days (e.g., "Monday of 1st Week after Pentecost").
- **Matins Gospels**: Included Resurrectional Matins Gospels for Sundays.
- **Vespers Paramia**: Added Old Testament readings for Vespers on feast days.
- **Indexing**: Corrected day numbering (Monday=0 to Sunday=6) for Pentecostarion weeks.

### 4. Technical Improvements
