THE ORDER OF THE MIDNIGHT
SERVICE

WEEKDAY MIDNIGHT SERVICE

If there is a priest, he says:

Blessed is our God, always, now and ever and forever.

And we say: Amen.

If there is no priest, say:

Through  the  prayers  of  our  holy  fathers,  O  Lord  Jesus

Christ, our God, have mercy on us.

We: Amen.

Glory to You, our God, glory to You!

Heavenly  King,  Comforter,  Spirit  of  Truth,  everywhere
present	and	filling	all	things,	Treasury	of	Blessings	and	Giver
of Life, come and dwell within us, cleanse us of all stain, and
save our souls, O gracious One.

Holy  God,  Holy  and  Mighty,  Holy  and  Immortal,  have

mercy on us. Three times.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,

now and ever and forever. Amen.

12

13

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovMost holy Trinity, have mercy on us; Lord, cleanse us of
our sins; Master, forgive our transgressions; Holy One, come
to	us	and	heal	our	infirmities	for	Your	Name’s	sake.

Lord, have mercy. Three times.

Glory: now and ever:

Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.
Thy  kingdom  come,  Thy  will  be  done  on  earth  as  it  is  in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our
trespasses  as  we  forgive  those  who  trespass  against  us,  and
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

The priest:

For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now and ever and forever.

And we: Amen.

Then: Lord, have mercy. 12.

Glory: now and ever:

Come, let us worship our King and God.
Come, let us worship Christ, our King and God.
Come, let us worship and bow before the only
Lord Jesus Christ, the King and our God.

And Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, God, in Your kindness.
In	Your	compassion	blot	out	my	offence.
O wash me more and more from my guilt
and cleanse me from my sin.

Weekday Midnight Service

My	offences	truly	I	know	them;
my sin is always before me.
Against You, You alone, have I sinned;
what is evil in Your sight I have done.

That	You	may	be	justified	when	You	give	sentence
and be without reproach when You judge
O see, in guilt was I born,
a sinner was I conceived.

Indeed You love truth in the heart;
then in the secret of my heart teach me wisdom;
O sprinkle me with hyssop then I shall be clean;
O wash me, I shall be whiter than snow.

Make me hear rejoicing and gladness,
that the bones You have crushed may thrill.
From my sins turn away Your face
and blot out all my guilt.

A pure heart create for me, O God,
put a steadfast spirit within me.
Do not cast me away from Your presence,
nor deprive me of Your Holy Spirit.

Give me again the joy of Your help;
with a spirit of fervor sustain me,
That I may teach transgressors Your ways
and sinners may return to You.

O rescue me, God, my helper,
and my tongue shall ring out Your goodness.

14

15

The Book of Hours:  Časoslov
O Lord, open my lips
and my mouth will declare Your praise.
For	in	sacrifice	You	take	no	delight,
Burnt	offering	from	me	You	would	refuse,
My	sacrifice	a	contrite	spirit.
A humbled, contrite heart, O God, You will not spurn.

In Your goodness, O Lord, show favor to Zion;
rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
Then	You	will	be	pleased	with	lawful	sacrifice,
(burnt	offerings	wholly	consumed),
Then	You	will	be	offered	young	bulls	on	Your	altar.

 [The Seventeenth Kathisma]

Psalm 118

They are happy whose life is blameless,
who	follow	God’s	law!
They are happy who do His will,
seeking Him with all their hearts,
who never do anything evil
but walk in His ways.
You have laid down Your precepts
to be obeyed with care.
May	my	footsteps	be	firm
to obey Your statutes.
Then I shall not be put to shame
as I heed Your commands.
I will thank You with an upright heart
as I learn Your decrees.
I will obey Your statutes:
do not forsake me.

16

Weekday Midnight Service

How long shall the young remain sinless?
By obeying Your word
I have sought You with all my heart:
Let me not stray from Your commands.
I treasure Your promise in my heart
lest I sin against You.
Blessed are You, O Lord;
teach me Your statutes.
With my tongue I have recounted
the decrees of Your lips.
I rejoiced to do Your will
as though all riches were mine.
I will ponder all Your precepts
and consider Your paths.
I take delight in Your statutes;
I will not forget Your word.

Bless Your servant and I shall live
and obey Your word.
Open my eyes that I may see
the wonders of Your law.
I am a pilgrim on the earth;
show me Your commands.
My soul is ever consumed
as I long for Your decrees.
You threaten the proud, the accursed,
who turn from Your commands.
Relieve me from scorn and contempt
for I do Your will.
Though princes sit plotting against me
I ponder on Your statutes.
Your will is my delight;
Your statutes are my counselors.

17

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovMy soul lies in the dust
By Your word revive me.
I declared my ways and You answered:
teach me Your statutes.
Make me grasp the way of Your precepts
and I will muse on Your wonders.
My soul pines away with grief;
by Your word raise me up.
Keep me from the way of error
and teach me Your law.
I have chosen the way of truth
with Your decrees before me.
I bind myself to do Your will;
Lord, do not disappoint me.
I will run the way of Your commands;
You give freedom to my heart.

Teach me the demands of Your statutes
and I will keep them to the end.
Train me to observe Your law,
to keep it with all my heart.
Guide me in the path of Your commands;
for there is my delight.
Bend my heart to Your will
and not to love of gain.
Keep my eyes from what is false;
by Your word, give me life.
Keep the promise You have made
to the servant who fears You.

Keep me from the scorn I dread,
for Your decrees are good.
See, I long for Your precepts;
then in Your justice, give me life.

18

Weekday Midnight Service

Lord, let Your love come upon me,
the saving help of Your promise.
And I shall answer those who taunt me
for I trust in Your word.
Do not take the word of Your truth from my mouth
for I trust in Your decrees.
I shall always keep Your law
for ever and ever.
I shall walk in the path of freedom
for I seek Your precepts.
I will speak of Your will before kings
and not be abashed.
Your commands have been my delight;
these I have loved.
I will worship Your commands and love them
and ponder Your statutes.

Remember Your word to Your servant
by which You gave me hope.
This is my comfort in sorrow
that Your promise gives me life.
Though the proud may utterly deride me
I keep to Your law.
I remember the decrees of old
and these, Lord, console me.
I am seized with indignation at the wicked
who forsake Your law.
Your statutes have become my song
in the land of exile.
I think of Your name in the night-time
and I keep Your law.
This has been my blessing,
the keeping of Your precepts.

19

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovMy part, I have resolved, O Lord,
is to obey Your word.
With all my heart I implore Your favor;
show the mercy of Your promise.
I have pondered over my ways
and returned to Your will.
I made haste and did not delay
to obey Your commands.
Though the nets of the wicked ensnared me
I remembered Your law.
At midnight I will rise and thank You
for Your just decrees.
I am a friend of all who revere You,
who obey Your precepts.
Lord,	Your	love	fills	the	earth.
Teach me Your statutes.

Lord, You have been good to Your servant
according to Your word.
Teach me discernment and knowledge
for I trust in Your commands.
Before	I	was	afflicted	I	strayed
but now I keep Your word.
You are good and Your deeds are good;
teach me Your statutes.
Though proud men smear me with lies
yet I keep Your precepts.
Their minds are closed to good
but Your law is my delight.
It	was	good	for	me	to	be	afflicted,
to learn Your statutes.
The law from Your mouth means more to me
than silver and gold.

Weekday Midnight Service

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,

now and ever and forever. Amen.

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.  Glory  to You,  O  God!  Three

times.

for Your law is my delight.
Shame the proud who harm me with lies
while I ponder Your precepts.
Let Your faithful turn to me,
those who know Your will.

lest I be ashamed.

I yearn for Your saving help;
I hope in Your word.
My eyes yearn to see Your promise.
When will You console me?
Though parched and exhausted with waiting
I remember Your statutes.
How	long	must	Your	servant	suffer?

20

21

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovWhen will You judge my foes?
For me the proud have dug pitfalls,
against the law.
Your commands are true; then help me
when lies oppress me.
They almost made an end of me on earth
but I kept Your precepts.
Because of Your love give me life
And I will do Your will.

Your word, O Lord, for ever
stands	firm	in	the	heavens:
Your truth lasts from age to age
like the earth You created.
By Your decree it endures to this day;
for all things serve You.
Had Your law not been my delight
I	would	have	died	in	my	affliction.
I will never forget Your precepts
for with them You give me life.

Middle

Save me, for I am Yours
since I seek Your precepts.
Though the wicked lie in wait to destroy me
yet I ponder on Your will.
I have seen that all perfection has an end
but Your command is boundless.

Lord, how I love Your law!
It is ever in my mind.
Your command makes me wiser than my foes;
for it is mine forever.

22

Weekday Midnight Service

I have more insight than all who teach me
for I ponder Your will.
I have more understanding than the old
for I keep Your precepts.
I turn my feet from evil paths
to obey Your word.
I have not turned from Your decrees;
You Yourself have taught me.
Your promise is sweeter to my taste
than honey in the mouth.
I gain understanding from Your precepts
and so I hate false ways.

Your word is a lamp to my steps
and a light to my path.
I have sworn and have made up my mind
to obey Your decrees.
Lord,	I	am	deeply	afflicted;
by Your word give me life.
Accept, Lord, the homage of my lips
and teach me Your decrees.
Though I carry my life in my hands,
I remember Your law.
Though the wicked try to ensnare me
I do not stray from Your precepts.
Your will is my heritage for ever,
the joy of my heart.
I set myself to carry out Your statutes
in fullness for ever.

I have no love for half-hearted men:

You are my shelter, my shield;

23

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovI hope in Your word.
Leave me, You who do evil;
I	will	keep	God’s	command.
If You uphold me by Your promise I shall live;
let my hopes be not in vain.
Sustain me and I shall be saved
and ever observe Your statutes.
You spurn all who swerve from Your statutes;
their cunning is in vain.
You throw away the wicked like dross;
so I love Your will.
I tremble before You in terror;
I fear Your decrees.

I have done what is right and just;
let me not be oppressed.
Vouch for the welfare of Your servant
lest the proud oppress me.
My eyes yearn for Your saving help
and the promise of Your justice.
Treat Your servant with love
and teach me Your statutes.
I am Your servant, give me knowledge;
then I shall know Your will.
It is time for the Lord to act
for Your law has been broken.
That is why I love Your commands
more	than	finest	gold,
why I rule my life by Your precepts;
and hate false ways.
Your will is wonderful indeed;
therefore I obey it.
The unfolding of Your word gives light

24

Weekday Midnight Service

I open my mouth and sigh
as I yearn for Your commands.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,

now and ever and forever. Amen.

Alleluia,  alleluia,  alleluia.  Glory  to You,  O  God!  Three

times.

let no evil rule me.
Redeem	me	from	man’s	oppression
and I will keep Your precepts.
Let Your face shine on Your servant
and teach me Your decrees.
Tears stream from my eyes
because Your law is disobeyed.

Lord, You are just indeed;
Your decrees are right.
You have imposed Your will with justice
and with absolute truth.
I am carried away by anger
for my foes forget Your word.
Your	promise	is	tried	in	the	fire,
the delight of Your servant.
Although I am weak and despised
I remember Your precepts.

25

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovYour justice is eternal justice
and Your law is truth.
Though anguish and distress have seized me,
I delight in Your commands.
The justice of Your will is eternal;
if You teach me, I shall live.

I call with all my heart; Lord, hear me,
I will keep Your statutes.
I call upon You; save me
and I will do Your will.
I rise before dawn and cry for help,
I hope in Your word.
My eyes watch through the night
to ponder Your promise.
In Your love hear my voice, O Lord;
give me life by Your decrees.
Those who harm me unjustly draw near;
they are far from Your law.
But You, O Lord, are close:
Your commands are truth.
Long have I known that Your will
is established for ever.

See	my	affliction	and	save	me
for I remember Your law.
Uphold my cause and defend me;
by Your promise, give me life.
Salvation is far from the wicked
who are heedless of Your statutes.
Numberless, Lord, are Your mercies;
with Your decrees give me life.
Though my foes and oppressors are countless

26

Weekday Midnight Service

I have not swerved from Your will.
I look at the faithless with disgust;
they ignore Your promise.
See how I love Your precepts;
In Your mercy give me life.
Your word is founded on truth;
Your decrees are eternal.

Though princes oppress me without cause
I stand in awe of Your word.
I take delight in Your promise
like	the	one	who	finds	a	treasure.
Lies I hate and detest
but Your law is my love.
Seven times a day I praise You
for Your just decrees.
The lovers of Your law have great peace;
they never stumble.
I await Your saving help, O Lord,
I	fulfill	Your	commands.
My soul obeys Your will
and loves it dearly.
I obey Your precepts and Your will;
all that I do is before You.

Lord, let my cry come before You;
teach me by Your word.
Let my pleading come before You;
save me by Your promise.
Let my lips proclaim Your praise
because You teach me Your statutes.
Let my tongue sing Your promise
for Your commands are just.

27

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovLet Your hand be ready to help me,
since I have chosen Your precepts.
Lord, how I long for Your saving help
and Your law is my delight.
Give life to my soul that I may praise You.
Let Your decrees give me help.
I am a lost sheep; seek Your servant
for I remember Your commands.

Glory: now and ever:

[The Symbol of Faith]

I  believe  in  one  God,  the  Father  Almighty,  Creator  of
heaven  and  earth,  of  all  things  visible  and  invisible;  and  in
one Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, the only-begotten, born
of the Father before all ages. Light from light, true God from
true God, begotten, not made, one in essence with the Father;
through Whom all things were made. For us men and for our
salvation, He came down from heaven, and was incarnate from
the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. He was
crucified	 for	 us	 under	 Pontius	 Pilate,	 and	 suffered	 and	 was
buried. He rose on the third day according to the scriptures.
He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the
Father; and He is coming again in glory to judge the living and
the dead, and His kingdom will have no end. And in the Holy
Spirit, the Lord, the Creator of Life, Who proceeds from the
Father. Together with the Father and the Son He is worshiped
and	 glorified;	 He	 spoke	 through	 the	 prophets.	 In	 one,	 holy,
catholic, and apostolic Church. I profess one baptism for the
remission of sins. I expect the resurrection of the dead and the
life of the world to come. Amen.

The Trisagion. Most Holy Trinity: After Our Father:

Weekday Midnight Service

The priest: For Thine is the kingdom:

Then the troparia, Tone 8:

Behold, the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night.
Blessed	 is	 the	 servant	 He	 shall	 find	 awake,	 but	 the	 one	 He
shall	 find	 neglectful	 will	 not	 be	 worthy	 of	 Him.	 Beware,
therefore,  O  my  soul!  Do  not  fall  into  a  deep  slumber,  lest
you  be  delivered  to  death  and  the  door  of  the  Kingdom  be
closed to you. Watch, instead, and cry out: Holy, holy, holy
are You, O God. Through the intercession of the Theotokos,
have mercy on us.

Glory:

Be alert, O my soul, as you think of that awesome day!
Light	 your	 lamp	 and	 keep	 it	 filled	 with	 oil,	 for	 you	 do	 not
know  the  hour  in  which  the  cry  will  come:  “Behold  the
Bridegroom!” Beware that you do not fall back to sleep, O my
soul,	and	wake	up	on	the	outside,	like	those	five	virgins.	But
watch constantly and you will see Christ! He will lead you to
the banquet hall of His glory.

Now and ever: Theotokion:

O Virgin Theotokos, fortress of salvation and invincible
wall,	 we	 pray	 to	 you:	 confound	 the	 enemies’	 counsels,	 turn
your	people’s	sorrow	to	joy,	protect	your	city.	Strengthen	the
government (or God-protected King), and pray for peace in
the world, for you are our hope, O Theotokos.

Then Lord, have mercy. 40.

28

29

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovAnd this prayer:

O  good  God,  in  all  times  and  in  all  places  You  are
worshiped	 and	 glorified	 both	 in	 heaven	 and	 on	 earth.	 You
are	 long-suffering	 and	 most-merciful.	You	 love	 the	 just	 and
show mercy to the sinner, calling all to salvation through the
promise of blessings to come. Do You, the same Lord, at this
hour receive our supplications and direct our lives in the path
of Your commandments. Sanctify our souls; purify our bodies;
set aright our minds; cleanse our thoughts; deliver us from all
affliction,	evil	and	illness;	surround	us	with	Your	holy	angels
so  that,  guided  and  guarded  in  their  camp,  we  may  attain
oneness of faith and the knowledge of Your unapproachable
glory, for You are blessed forever and ever. Amen.

Lord, have mercy. Three times.

Glory: now and ever:

More honorable than the cherubim, and beyond compare
more glorious than the seraphim; who, a virgin, gave birth to
God the Word, you, truly the Theotokos, we magnify.

Give the blessing, Father, in the Name of the Lord.

The priest:

[Numbers 6:24-26]

May God be merciful to us and bless us; may He cause

His countenance to shine upon us, and have mercy on us.

Weekday Midnight Service

If there is no priest, say:

Through  the  prayers  of  our  holy  fathers,  O  Lord  Jesus

Christ our God, have mercy on us.

We: Amen.

_________________________________________________

And  if  it  is  [a  period  when]  Alleluia  [is  sung],  say  this
prayer of Saint Ephrem, making a great prostration after each
of the three parts:

Lord  and  Master  of  my  life,  spare  me  from  the  spirit
of	 indifference,	 despair,	 lust	 for	 power,	 and	 idle	 chatter.
Prostration.

Instead, bestow on me, Your servant, the spirit of integrity,

humility, patience and love. Prostration.

Yes, O Lord and King, let me see my own sins, and not
judge my brothers and sisters, for You are blessed, forever and
ever. Amen. Prostration.

Then twelve small bows, saying at each bow:

O God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
O God, cleanse me of my sins and have mercy on me.
O Lord, forgive me for I have sinned without number.

And again, this prayer a final time:

Lord and Master of my life: to the end: forever and ever.

Amen. And one great prostration.
_________________________________________________

31

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovThen, this prayer:

 [Prayer to the Holy Trinity by Saint Mardarius]

O God, Master, Almighty Father; only-begotten Son, Lord
Jesus Christ; and You, O Holy Spirit, One God, One Power,
have  mercy  on  me,  a  sinner,  and  save  me,  Your  unworthy
servant, according to the ways of Your wisdom. For You are
blessed forever and ever. Amen.

However, if it is not a period of Alleluia, omit Lord and
Master  of  my  life:  and  the  bows  and  say  only:  O  God  our
Master, Almighty Father:

[Mesorion]

Then Come, let us worship: Three times

And the psalms:

Psalm 120

I lift up my eyes to the mountains;
from where shall come my help?
My help is from the Lord
Who made heaven and earth.

May He never allow you to stumble!
Let Him sleep not your guard.
No, He sleeps not nor stumbles,
Israel’s	guard.

The Lord is your guard and your shade;
on your right hand He stands.
By day the sun shall not smite you
nor the moon in the night.

Weekday Midnight Service

The Lord will guard you from evil,
He will guard your soul.
The Lord will guard your going and coming
both now and for ever.

Psalm 133

O come, bless the Lord,
all you who serve the Lord,
Who stand in the house of the Lord,
in the courts of the house of our God.

Lift up your hands to the holy place
and bless the Lord through the night.

May the Lord bless you from Zion,
He who made both heaven and earth.

Glory: now and ever:

Trisagion: Most Holy Trinity: and after Our Father: For

Thine is the kingdom:

And these troparia, Tone 2:

O Lord, in Your goodness, remember Your servants and
forgive whatever sins they committed in their life; for no one
is sinless but You alone. You have the power to grant rest to
the departed.

[Tone 8]

In the depth of Your wisdom, O only Creator, You govern
all with love and supply the needs of each. Now give rest to
the souls of Your servants, for they have placed their hope in
You, our Creator, Maker, and our God.

32

33

The Book of Hours:  ČasoslovGlory: Kontakion:

With the saints, O Christ, give rest to Your servants where

there is no pain, sorrow, nor mourning, but life everlasting.

Now and ever: Theotokion:

All generations call you blessed, O Virgin Theotokos, for
Christ our God, the Uncontainable, willed to be contained in
you. We also are blessed having you as a mediatrix, for day
and  night  you  pray  for  us. The  authority  of  governments  is
upheld through your prayers. Therefore, with hymns we cry
out to you: Rejoice, full of grace, the Lord is with you.

Lord, have mercy. 12.

And this prayer:

O Lord, remember our departed fathers and brothers and
sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of resurrection to
eternal life and all who have been made perfect in piety and
faith, and forgive them all their sins voluntary or involuntary,
by word, deed, or thought. Let their dwelling place be a place
of light, joy, and peace, where there is no pain, sorrow, nor
mourning, where the light of Your countenance shines forth
and  gladdens  all  Your  saints  from  the  ages.  Bestow  Your
kingdom  upon  them  and  upon  us.  Grant  that  we  may  share
the good things of eternity, those delights which words cannot
describe,  the  delights  of  eternal  happiness.  For You  are  the
resurrection, the life, and the repose of Your departed servants,
O Christ our God, and we give glory to You with Your eternal
Father, and Your all-holy, good, and life-creating Spirit, now
and ever and forever. Amen.

Weekday Midnight Service

On  holy  Mount  Athos,  after  O  Lord,  remember:  the

following troparia are said, Tone 6:

Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: since we
have	no	defense,	we	sinners	offer	this	supplication	to	You,	our
Master; have mercy on us.

Glory:

Lord,  have  mercy  on  us,  for  in You  we  place  our  hope.
Be  not  exceedingly  angry  with  us,  nor  mindful  of  our
transgressions,  but  look  upon  us  even  now  with  mercy,  and
deliver us from our enemies. For You are our God and we are
Your people: we all are the work of Your hands, and we call
upon Your Name.

Now and ever:

Open unto us the doors of mercy, O blessed Theotokos.
Let us not perish who place our trust in you, but rather through
you be delivered from misfortune. For you are the salvation
of all Christians.

Then the priest says the ektenia:

Have mercy on us, O God, according to Your great mercy,

we pray You, hear and have mercy.

Choir: Lord, have mercy. Three times.

Again, let us pray that He preserve this city (or this village)
and this holy church (if at a monastery: this holy monastery)
and  every  city,  town,  and  community  from  famine,  plague,
earthquake,	 flood,	 fire,	 civil	 war,	 riot,	 and	 foreign	 invasion;
and  that  our  God Who  is  kindly  and  the  Lover  of  Mankind

34

35

The Book of Hours:  Časoslovmay forgive our sins and hold back His just wrath, and that He
may have mercy on us.

Choir: Lord, have mercy 12.

Exclamation:

Hear us, O God our Savior, Hope of all the ends of the
earth  and  of  those  who  are  far  away  upon  the  sea,  and  be
merciful,  be  merciful,  Master,  regarding  our  sins,  and  have
mercy on us. For You are a merciful God Who loves mankind,
and we give glory to You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, now
and ever and forever.
Choir: Amen.

[The Dismissal]

The priest:

Weekday Midnight Service

Honorable fathers and brothers, bless and forgive me, a
sinner. I have sinned this day (this night) and all the days of
my life, in word, deed, or thought, with all my spiritual and
bodily faculties.

And all the brethren respond thus:

Honorable father: may God forgive you and have mercy

on you.

After this all the brethren make a bow to the superior or

the priest, asking pardon:

Honorable father, bless and forgive me, a sinner. I have
sinned this day (this night) and all the days of my life, in word,
deed, or thought, with all my spiritual and bodily faculties.

Glory to You, O Christ God, our hope, glory to You.

The superior or priest responds:

Choir:  Glory:  now  and  ever:  Lord,  have  mercy.  Three

May God forgive your sins by His grace and have mercy

times. Give the blessing.

on all of you.

The priest says the dismissal:

Extracted Lord's Prayer (constant chunk):
Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.

Extracted Troparia Block (variable chunk, changes by day/tone):
Behold, the Bridegroom comes in the middle of the night.
Blessed	 is	 the	 servant	 He	 shall	 find	 awake,	 but	 the	 one	 He
shall	 find	 neglectful	 will	 not	 be	 worthy	 of	 Him.	 Beware,
therefore,  O  my  soul!  Do  not  fall  into  a  deep  slumber,  lest
you  be  delivered  to  death  and  the  door  of  the  Kingdom  be
closed to you. Watch, instead, and cry out: Holy, holy, holy
are You, O God. Through the intercession of the Theotokos,
have mercy on us.

Glory:

Be alert, O my soul, as you think of that awesome day!
Light	 your	 lamp	 and	 keep	 it	 filled	 with	 oil,	 for	 you	 do	 not
know  the  hour  in  which  the  cry  will  come:  “Behold  the
Bridegroom!” Beware that you do not fall back to sleep, O my
soul,	and	wake	up	on	the	outside,	like	those	five	virgins.	But
watch constantly and you will see Christ! He will lead you to
the banquet hall of His glory.

Now and ever: Theotokion:

O Virgin Theotokos, fortress of salvation and invincible
wall,	 we	 pray	 to	 you:	 confound	 the	 enemies’	 counsels,	 turn
your	people’s	sorrow	to	joy,	protect	your	city.	Strengthen	the
government (or God-protected King), and pray for peace in
the world, for you are our hope, O Theotokos.
