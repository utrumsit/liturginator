our souls.

luminary for the world, inspired adornment of monks, O wise
John, harp of the Spirit, you enlightened all by your teachings;

Let us praise John, the composer of hymns and honorable
spokesman of God, the teacher and instructor of the church,

care for the soul, which is immortal. Therefore, O venerable
Patapius, your soul rejoices with the angels.

Kontakion, Tone 3:

The people who come to your temple with reverence, O

understanding into the hearts of your servants.

Troparion of the Wonder-worker, Tone 1:

You were revealed as a champion of the First Council, and
a wonderworker, our God-bearing father Spiridon; for you
called out to the woman dead in the tomb and you transformed
the serpent into gold. And when you sang your holy prayers,
you had angels serving with you, O most holy one. Glory to
Him Who gave you strength. Glory to Him Who granted a
crown to you! Glory to Him Who through you grants healing
to all.

The Holy Prophet Daniel and the Three Holy
 Children, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael.

their prayers, O Christ our God, save our souls.

header: Menologion - December

Kontakion of the Prophet, Tone 3:

Your pure heart was enlightened by the Holy Spirit so that
it could become an instrument of prophecy; you perceived
distant events as if they were present. When you were thrown
into the pit, you stopped the lions’ mouths. Therefore, we
honor you, O blessed and glorious prophet Daniel.

Kontakion of the Children, Tone 6:

You did not worship a man-made image, O thrice-blessed

 the Branded, Brother of Theophane the

First martyr and Apostle of Christ, you fought the good

you were deemed worthy to baptize in the waters the Lord you
had proclaimed. Therefore, you fought for the truth, and with
joy proclaimed the good news to those in Hades, that God has
appeared in the flesh to take away the sins of the world and to
grant us great mercy.

Or this, in the same tone:

O prophet, Forerunner, and dweller in the desert, you
heard the divine voice of the Father, you were deemed worthy
to baptize the Son and Lord, and you were a witness of the
Holy Spirit. Having proclaimed the baptism of repentence,
now ask for us the forgiveness of sins, that through your
prayers we may receive the great mercy of Christ our God.

Kontakion, Tone 6:

The River Jordan trembled, and was driven back filled
with fear at your coming in the flesh, while John drew back

God for all of us.

Kontakion of the Hierarch, Tone 2:

You practiced asceticism on earth as if without flesh,

save our souls.

Kontakion, Tone 4:

As a server of the sacred mysteries of the Holy Trinity,
and as a preacher of the divine commandments beyond
